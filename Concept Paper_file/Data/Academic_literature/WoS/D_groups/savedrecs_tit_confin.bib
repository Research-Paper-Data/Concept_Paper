Title = {Finance and biodiversity conservation: insights from rhinoceros
   conservation and the first wildlife conservation bond},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {The Rhino Bond is the first financial instrument dedicated to protecting
   a species. The Bond allows investors to invest in the conservation of
   the black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, with the amount of money returned
   by the investment depending on whether rhinoceros numbers increase (and
   by how much). In this paper we focus on how the Bond was brought into
   being. We draw on an analysis of organizational reports along with data
   collected from interviews with key informants to investigate the roles
   of the various stakeholders in the Bond, how species and sites were
   selected, the motivations and experiences of the stakeholders and the
   involvement of stakeholders in decision-making. We found that although
   conservation actors are attracted by the potential for new funding, they
   have experienced challenges navigating complex financial instruments.
   The needs of financial actors often dictated decision-making, with
   implications for the species and sites chosen for the Bond. As profits
   are tied to an increase in population size of a specific species (which
   needs to be monitored), the instrument has favoured large and easily
   counted species and populations. Only some sites were able to meet the
   stringent conditions of financial instruments, including metrics on
   financial sustainability. We argue that the dominance of financial
   principles and motives means that not all species or sites will be
   viable candidates for investment and that conservation finance should
   not be seen as a panacea.},

Abstract = {Using a panel of parcel-level data we estimate a hazard model and find
   strong evidence that the mere existence of an option to preserve
   farmland delays decisions to convert farmland to developed uses by about
   six years, a reduction in median conversion time of 12 to 43\% depending
   on parcel size. Where such delays allow local governments to improve
   infrastructure or implement stricter growth control measures, benefits
   of a preservation option may be even more long term. Also, increases in
   the variance of returns to development tended to slow conversion for
   parcels with all but the highest lot capacities.},

Abstract = {Climate change is now underway and is likely to have far-reaching
   impacts on the global environment and human welfare. While addressing
   this problem will require a fundamental transformation in energy use,
   carbon sequestration (i.e., storage) strategies can also play an
   important role. These strategies include preserving threatened forests
   and promoting ecosystem restoration of degraded lands, Such strategies
   not only help to address climate change but also contribute
   significantly to conserving the earth's highly threatened forest
   ecosystems and biological diversity ({''}biodiversity{''}) - resources
   which are critical to human prosperity and survival. The Nature
   Conservancy has pioneered forest carbon sequestration projects in Latin
   America. The largest such project, Noel Kempff Climate Action Project in
   Bolivia, is described in detail, including some of the major design
   issues and challenges. The article concludes with a brief discussion of
   why the insurance industry might be motivated to participate in carbon
   sequestration strategies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Increase in human activities owing to the rise in consumption demand is
   increasing the risk of biodiversity loss. To address this concern,
   several conservation activities are being undertaken, including those
   that find their basis in finance. This paper highlights the role of
   finance towards biodiversity conservation, which is illustrated by
   taking into consideration one of the tools commonly used in financial
   risk management, namely, derivatives. The paper infers that derivatives
   can be directly applied to biodiversity conservation. In addition, it
   also highlights the possibility of specific derivatives such as energy
   and weather derivatives to indirectly contribute to conservation.
   Despite the challenges involved, such as pricing of biodiversity
   elements and assessment of loss, the possibility of applying derivatives
   to minimize the risk of biodiversity loss exists.},

Abstract = {Identifying and treating erosion-prone, critical source areas (CSA)
   presents the opportunity to effectively address erosion at a watershed
   scale. Social and financial drivers of conservation adoption, however
   have buffered implementation. An integrated systems understanding is
   needed to identify internal feedbacks and potential synergistic
   conservation policies. We simulate the physical, social, and financial
   incentive interactions with a high-level system dynamics model to
   understand the conservation adoption and subsequent erosion behavior of
   the system. A Bass diffusion model integrated with physical modeling
   results enables the simulation of CSA, the diffusion of innovations, and
   payment for conservation practices. Land retirement and tillage
   reduction best management practices are assessed for the dryland wheat
   farming region in the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States.
   Model utility was confirmed with quantitative land management data and
   qualitative local expertise. Historical, voluntary-based efforts to
   reduce erosion suffer marginal returns. We conclude that: (1) All
   targeting of CSA reduces long-term erosion rates; (2) The most effective
   use of conservation funds, however, occurs when the diffusion of
   innovation mechanism is reinforced by broad-scale payments for tillage
   reduction; and (3) By identifying and utilizing positive feedback, our
   simulations suggest large gains in erosion reduction and conservation
   fund efficiency are possible.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {I reviewed some of the financial mechanisms for biodiversity
   conservation activities in Brazil. There is a heavy dependence on the
   public sector, but macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing government
   spending have resulted in reduced budgets dedicated to public
   conservation. measures. The financial constraints for environmental
   protection have also increased because of a reduction in foreign aid.
   Positive signs for the immediate future, however, come from new
   initiatives that create economic instruments to finance conservation.
   The most important initiatives include conservation criteria for tax
   redistribution; environmental compensation; water charges; royalties for
   electricity, petroleum, and natural gas; tradable obligations for forest
   reserves; and voluntary measures on the part of the business sector.
   Resources created from these initiatives have different origins and are
   managed by different public agencies according to varying laws and
   policies, so their efficient implementation will require that the
   institutions involved in biodiversity conservation in Brazil establish a
   minimum set of common priorities and objectives.},

Title = {Conservation finance and sustainable tourism: the acceptability of
   conservation fees to support the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},

Pages = {1353-1366},
Abstract = {Protected areas are key to the conservation of global biodiversity and
   ecosystem services; however, their success is contingent upon adequate
   funding. One possibility to increase funding for park management is to
   sell a wider suite of ecosystem services produced by protected areas,
   such as carbon sequestration. We conducted 420 tourist surveys to
   analyze willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem service benefits via a
   conservation fee in the Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. We also
   interviewed eight tour operators about their perceptions of the proposed
   fee. The average stated WTP was 15 USD. Sixty-six percent of tourists
   stated they would pay 10 USD or more, which, if actually paid, would
   have resulted in 318,000 USD for park management in 2015. Most
   respondents stated they would pay an additional fee if it supported
   biodiversity conservation or local ecosystem services, such as water,
   but less than 10\% of tourists were motivated by carbon sequestration as
   a reason to pay the fee. Most tour operators supported the additional
   fee. Our findings suggest that tourists are willing to pay higher fees
   to support conservation but that interest in paying for additional
   ecosystem services from parks may not extend to global and intangible
   benefits such as carbon sequestration.},

Abstract = {We have developed an add-on tool for use with the Agricultural
   Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) that features a multistate
   financial analysis and field-scale nitrogen (N) reduction tool for use
   when analyzing different ACPF conservation scenarios. Financial and
   expected field-scale N loss data are used to calculate total long-term
   cost and cost effectiveness of various conservation plans. Unique to the
   ACPF Financial and Nutrient Reduction Tool is the ability to identify
   individual treatment areas for each practice evaluated, allowing users
   to create combinatorial conservation planning scenarios drawing from
   multiple ACPF-identified conservation practices. Financial data account
   for direct long-term annualized costs for best management practice (BMP)
   installation and management in Iowa and Minnesota. Opportunity costs of
   BMPs that retire cropland are spatially determined according to
   weighted-average crop productivity indices and land rent relationships.
   The tool quantifies the N requirements for each field, based on 6-yr
   land-use data, and evaluates the proportion of N likely to be lost from
   the field as nitrate load via leaching. Financial analyses that can be
   accomplished by using the ACPF are illustrated in case study watershed
   scenarios in Iowa and Minnesota. In Iowa, featured scenarios range from
   26 to 31\% reduction in total nitrate, for a total cost between
   US\$0.580 million and \$2.3 million per year, respectively. In
   Minnesota, example scenarios range from 28 to 51\% total nitrate
   reduction, for total costs of \$1.7 million to \$2.1 million per year.
   Tradeoffs in BMP selection related to N reduction outcome and cost are
   also demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Land-acquisition strategies employed by conservation organizations vary
   in their flexibility. Conservation-planning theory largely fails to
   reflect this by presenting models that are either extremely
   inflexibleparcel acquisitions are irreversible and budgets are fixedor
   extremely flexiblepreviously acquired parcels can readily be sold. This
   latter approach, the selling of protected areas, is infeasible or
   problematic in many situations. We considered the value to conservation
   organizations of increasing the flexibility of their land-acquisition
   strategies through their approach to financing deals. Specifically, we
   modeled 2 acquisition-financing methods commonly used by conservation
   organizations: borrowing and budget carry-over. Using simulated data, we
   compared results from these models with those from an inflexible
   fixed-budget model and an extremely flexible selling model in which
   previous acquisitions could be sold to fund new acquisitions. We then
   examined 3 case studies of how conservation organizations use borrowing
   and budget carry-over in practice. Model comparisons showed that
   borrowing and budget carry-over always returned considerably higher
   rewards than the fixed-budget model. How they performed relative to the
   selling model depended on the relative conservation value of past
   acquisitions. Both the models and case studies showed that incorporating
   flexibility through borrowing or budget carry-over gives conservation
   organizations the ability to purchase parcels of higher conservation
   value than when budgets are fixed without the problems associated with
   the selling of protected areas.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Global water use for food production needs to be reduced to remain
   within planetary boundaries, yet the financial feasibility of crucial
   measures to reduce water use is poorly quantified. Here, we introduce a
   novel method to compare the costs of water conservation measures with
   the added value that reallocation of water savings might generate if
   used for expansion of irrigation. Based on detailed water accounting
   through the use of a high-resolution hydrology-crop model, we modify the
   traditional cost curve approach with an improved estimation of demand
   and increasing marginal cost per water conservation measure combination,
   adding a correction to control for impacts on downstream water
   availability. We apply the method to three major river basins in the
   Indo-Gangetic plain (Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra), a major global food
   producing region but increasingly water stressed. Our analysis shows
   that at basin level only about 10\% (Brahmaputra) to just over 20\%
   (Indus and Ganges) of potential water savings would be realized; the
   equilibrium price for water is too low to make the majority of water
   conservation measures cost effective. The associated expansion of
   irrigated area is moderate, about 7\% in the Indus basin, 5\% in the
   Ganges and negligible in the Brahmaputra, but farmers' gross profit
   increases more substantially, by 11\%. Increasing the volumetric cost of
   irrigation water influences supply and demand in a similar way and has
   little influence on water reallocation. Controlling for the impact on
   return flows is important and more than halves the amount of water
   available for reallocation.},

Abstract = {The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) administered by the
   U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service
   (NRCS) was developed to encourage producer adoption of practices that
   promote resource conservation on lands in agricultural production.
   Reviewing the 2002 Farm Bill, EQIP rules, and local EQIP structure using
   Michigan as a case study, producers had ample opportunity to participate
   in EQIP. Yet past EQIP support of pest, nutrient, and conservation
   vegetation management was low among six states from 1997 to 2002,
   averaging 1.1\% to 2.7\% of total EQIP funds allocated. The past funding
   pattern and analysis of local resource concern priorities and incentive
   rates suggested that program modifications were warranted. The Michigan
   case study showed that participation in the NRCS advisory process, in
   partnership with commodity representatives and university specialists
   was an effective avenue to recommend and obtain local EQIP
   modifications. After modifications were accepted in Michigan, increases
   were seen in producer participation in EQIP and in funds committed
   (about 15\%) to adoption of a variety of techniques with pest, nutrient,
   and conservation vegetation value. This approach of analysis and
   engagement in the EQIP process is likely to work in other states, given
   common EQIP structure and governance, past funding patterns, and
   availability of supporting extension, research, and commodity partners.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Conservation in the Anthropocene requires financing that is commensurate
   to the scale of threats to ecosystems and the benefits they provide
   humanity. To meet this challenge, new financing models are needed at a
   diversity of scales to help support the protection of nature. Visitor
   green fees - or payments made by visitors to management authorities, for
   the explicit purpose of funding natural resource management - are an
   innovative conservation financing tool. In contrast to park fees, these
   conservation finance systems operate at the scale of an entire
   jurisdiction, rather than a specific protected area, park or reserve.
   Despite their recent proliferation worldwide, there is little to no
   scholarly literature on visitor green fees. In this paper, we assess ten
   visitor green fee programs worldwide and evaluate their fee system,
   governance, and management approach. Our over-arching purpose is to
   explore the challenges and opportunities associated with these
   conservation financing models, to inform both the evaluation of existing
   models and to aid practitioners seeking to establish systems to enhance
   financing for conservation and the ecosystem services that nature
   provides tourism-dependent destinations.},

Abstract = {In this paper I emphasise the financialisation of environmental
   conservation as 1. the turning of financiers to conservation parameters
   as a new frontier for investment, and 2. the rewriting of conservation
   practice and nonhuman worlds in terms of banking and financial
   categories. I introduce financialisation as a broadly controlling
   impetus with relevance for environmental conservation. I then note ways
   in which a spectacular investment frontier in conservation is being
   opened. I highlight the draw of assertions of lucrative gains, combined
   with notions of geographical substitutability, in creating tradable
   indicators of environmental health and harm. I disaggregate
   financialisation strategies into four categoriesnature finance, nature
   work, nature banking and nature derivativesand assess their
   implications. The concluding section embraces Marx and Foucault as
   complementary thinkers in understanding the transforming
   intensifications of late capitalism in environmental conservation, and
   diagnosing their associated effects and costs.},

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {499-510},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Financial incentives may aid in conservation if they broaden the numbers
   and types of landowners who engage in protection and conservation
   management on private land. We examined the hypotheses that financial
   incentives (1) encourage participation of people with lower autonomous
   motivation towards conservation and lower self-transcendence (i.e.
   benevolence and universalism) values compared to participants in similar
   programmes without such incentives; (2) enable more on-ground works and
   activities; and (3) enhance feelings of competence and autonomy with
   respect to conservation actions. We surveyed 193 landowners in private
   land conservation programmes in Tasmania, only some of whom had received
   financial incentives. All of these landowners had high
   self-transcendence values, and autonomous motivation towards the
   environment. Owners of large properties and participants with higher
   self-enhancement values, lower self-transcendence values and lower
   autonomous motivation towards the environment were slightly more likely
   to engage in incentive programmes. However, people who received funding
   did not report more conservation actions than people in programmes
   without incentives. Owners of larger properties receiving incentives
   reported fewer conservation actions. Thus financial incentives probably
   recruited a few into nature conservation who may not have otherwise
   engaged, but did not result in a more intensive level of conservation
   management. Our results caution against the blanket-use of incentives
   amongst landowners who may already have values and motivations
   consistent with environmental action, and point to the need for further
   research on the socio-psychological characteristics of landowners, to
   examine the contextual factors that influence the effects of
   conservation payments.},

Abstract = {The forests of SE Cameroon lie within the Sangha tri-national landscape
   (TNS), a priority area for biodiversity conservation under the Congo
   Basin Forest Partnership. A monitoring program showed minimal changes in
   conservation and local livelihoods indicators from 2006 to 2008.
   Following the global financial crisis in late 2008 global demand for
   timber decreased and this led to suspension of logging activities and
   lay-offs of staff by logging companies; both biodiversity and livelihood
   indicators deteriorated. The unemployed workers lost their incomes,
   experienced declining living standards and reverted to poaching and
   slash and burn agriculture. Pygmies were no longer able to obtain
   employment in Bantu agricultural plots, sell forest products to logging
   company employees or sell bushmeat to passing logging trucks. These
   global economic forces had greater impact on livelihoods and the
   environment than local interventions by conservation organizations.
   Livelihood indicators improved in 2010 and 2011 when the economy
   picked-up but those for environmental values did not recover as rapidly.},

Title = {Financial Analysis of Habitat Conservation Banking in California},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Habitat conservation banking is a policy instrument for conserving
   endangered species by providing financial incentives for the landowners
   in the United States. This policy instrument aims to protect habitat,
   but little or no thought has been given to its financial performance. A
   financial analysis of habitat conservation banks (HCB) informs
   policymakers and conservation biologists of the long-term success of
   this policy and the future of HCBs. This paper evaluates 26 habitat
   conservation banks (HCB) in California by calculating their Net Present
   Values (NPV). We do so by compiling the cost and revenue data for
   habitat conservation banks. The average annual cost of operating HCBs
   was \$42.78/acre (median: \$22.58/acre), and the average credit price or
   revenue from credit sale was \$6014.72/acre (median: \$553.65/acre). The
   average NPV for 26 HCBs was \$4205.90/acre at a 4\% rate of return,
   indicating an overall positive return from such an easement instrument.
   However, only 14 HCBs out of 26 produced a positive return. With the
   inclusion of land acquisition costs, three of eight HCBs performed
   financially well. On the brighter side, the number of HCBs has increased
   with time. But there is not enough evidence to ascertain financial
   certainty from their revenues. A right selection of space (land
   acquisition costs can make or break finances for HCB) and species could
   encourage landowners to establish HCBs. This could build confidence on
   those who may have been discouraged from lack of knowledge and fear of
   losing revenue due to regulatory compliance to conserve endangered
   species habitat in their land. The findings are helpful in identifying
   lands and prioritizing investments to generate conservation credits.},

Abstract = {The article starts by examining the idea of conservation laws as applied
   to market economies. It formulates a measure of financial entropy and

   discuss an analogue for free energy released during this process. The
   concepts of real and symbolic appropriation are introduced as a means to
   analyse debt and taxation. We then examine the conflict between the
   conservation laws that apply to commodity exchange with the exponential
   growth implied by capital accumulation and how these have necessitated a
   sequence of evolutionary forms for money, and go on to present a simple
   stochastic model for the formation of rates of interest and a model for
   the time evolution of the rate of profit.},

   operating costs and greenhouse emissions. However, one of the barriers
   to the implementation of such projects is the limited availability of
   financial resources. Pinch Analysis, which was initially developed to
   conserve thermal energy and improve energy efficiency in industrial
   processes, is extended in this paper to address the problem of energy
   conservation project selection. A new method is developed to include
   financial cash flows for appropriate selection among independent
   projects. This study applies. Financial Pinch Analysis to select
   multiple independent projects from a large pool of candidate projects,
   subject to different funding constraints. To account for the time value
   of money, Net Present Value is used to determine the financial
   feasibility of the projects against various funding options. The
   applicability of the proposed method considers a pool of projects with
   equal and unequal lives, as well as the financial risk associated with
   individual projects. In this study, risk is estimated by calculating the
   certainty equivalent cash flows of the projects. A graphical approach to
   obtain optimal insightful solutions is presented and demonstrated
   through three illustrative examples of energy conservation projects in
   the pulp and paper and cement industries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Government is the primary financer of conservation services, but
   conservation financing in government is rarely studied. This study makes
   two contributions to understanding conservation financing in government.
   First, it develops a framework to classify and analyse conservation
   funding. Applying this framework to the data from Florida county
   governments, this study finds that conservation funding has become more
   stable and secure. More resources are used for large and long-term
   capital projects that benefit not only the current generation but also
   future generations, which reflects the ultimate goal of conservation.
   Second, this research offers an explanation about why some governments
   spend more on conservation than others. The results suggest that
   conservation funding in government is the result of combined forces in
   environmental pressure of economic activities and budgetary politics.
   The paper concludes that government should develop a structured
   conservation funding strategy that includes close monitoring of
   environmental pressure and proper political and institutional responses
   to the pressure.},

Title = {Bringing tropical forest biodiversity conservation into financial
   accounting calculation},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {688-714},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to examine how the biodiversity comprising a
   tropical forest ecosystem is being protected as a result of having its
   conservation brought into financial accounting calculations by
   constructing a greenhouse gas emissions offset product to sell on the
   voluntary over-the-counter carbon markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research examines a single embedded
   case study of a biodiversity conservation project in Kenya. The
   resulting discussion builds upon the existing accounting and
   organisation studies literature regarding the construction of markets.
   Findings - Whilst the case examined does successfully bring tropical
   forest biodiversity conservation into the financial accounting
   calculations of the sellers and buyers of the offset product, via
   processes of objectification and singularisation, there are considerable
   accounting obstacles to constructing a calculative mechanism capable of
   achieving this on a global scale to facilitate financing of the
   conservation of all the world's remaining tropical forest biodiversity.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the debate on accounting
   for biodiversity by examining market construction as a theoretical
   framework for turning the loss/conservation of biodiversity from an
   externality into an entity that is taken into account in organisations'
   calculations of profit and loss.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest loss and degradation due to human activities have been
   persistent and intractable global problems. Model estimates suggest that
   current levels of finance for conservation and sustainable forest
   management (SFM) are insufficient and may need to increase by an order
   of magnitude in order to meet this challenge. This special issue
   presents select articles from the 2014 Yale International Society of
   Tropical Foresters (ISTF) Annual Conference, which explored diverse
   finance mechanisms such as REDD+, sustainability certification,
   ecological compensation, community forestry, and official development
   assistance. Each finance mechanism has advantages and disadvantages,
   which render them effective under specific circumstances. Comprehensive
   tropical forest conservation will require a diverse portfolio of finance
   strategies appropriate for local institutional and ecological
   conditions. Hybrid strategies combining elements of multiple schemes
   could bolster conservation and SFM efforts by leveraging their
   respective strengths. Clear and realistic targets and baselines, robust
   monitoring and measurement-reporting-verification, strong governance and
   institutions, and periodic evaluation can contribute to the successful
   application of forest conservation finance. Due to the potentially high
   damages, especially to the world's poorest communities from continuing
   current deforestation trends, substantially greater financing of
   tropical conservation and SFM is a sound global investment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {584-603},
Abstract = {Many commentators suggest that tourism could help fund the ever growing
   number of protected areas. The traditional reliance on government
   sources to support protected areas is increasingly untenable, in both
   the developed and developing world. This paper reviews the relationship
   between tourism and protected areas to assess opportunities for
   sustainable funding to assure effective stewardship. It explores a range
   of innovative and creative alternative funding mechanisms which could be
   consistent with a positive evolving relationship between tourism and
   protected areas. An outline classification of four protected area
   archetypes for management and funding purposes is suggested, based on a
   combination of visitation and biodiversity levels. To service the
   management of those four types, a series of non-government revenue
   streams are explored such as payments for ecosystem service (ES),
   environmental mortgages, intrinsic value funding, carbon abatement
   funding and research dividend funding. Issues discussed include: the
   willingness to pay on the part of potential visitors, the potential
   impact of fees on visitation, ``quarantining{''} particularly valuable
   ecosystems from visitation and intrinsic value funding, the
   unpredictability of environmental mortgages and the potential stability
   of ES payments. Further research is required in data analysis and into
   the design of land tenure systems and regulatory mechanisms.},

Title = {Financial Costs of Large Carnivore Translocations - Accounting for
   Conservation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Human-carnivore conflict continues to present a major conservation
   challenge around the world. Translocation of large carnivores is widely
   implemented but remains strongly debated, in part because of a lack of
   cost transparency. We report detailed translocation costs for three
   large carnivore species in Namibia and across different translocation
   scenarios. We consider the effect of various parameters and factors on
   costs and translocation success. Total translocation cost for 30
   individuals in 22 events was \$80,681 (US Dollars). Median translocation
   cost per individual was \$2,393, and \$2,669 per event. Median cost per
   cheetah was \$2,760 (n = 23), and \$2,108 per leopard (n = 6). One
   hyaena was translocated at a cost of \$1,672. Tracking technology was
   the single biggest cost element (56\%), followed by captive holding and
   feeding. Soft releases, prolonged captivity and orphaned individuals
   also increased case-specific costs. A substantial proportion (65.4\%) of
   the total translocation cost was successfully recovered from public
   interest groups. Less than half the translocations were confirmed
   successes (44.4\%, 3 unknown) with a strong species bias. Four leopards
   (66.7\%) were successfully translocated but only eight of the 20
   cheetahs (40.0\%) with known outcome met these strict criteria. None of
   the five habituated cheetahs was translocated successfully, nor was the
   hyaena. We introduce the concept of Individual Conservation Cost (ICC)
   and define it as the cost of one successfully translocated individual
   adjusted by costs of unsuccessful events of the same species. The median
   ICC for cheetah was \$6,898 and \$3,140 for leopard. Translocations are
   costly, but we demonstrate that they are not inherently more expensive
   than other strategies currently employed in non-lethal carnivore
   conflict management. We conclude that translocation should be one
   available option for conserving large carnivores, but needs to be
   critically evaluated on a case-by-case basis.},

   species depends on certain types of conservation measures being carried
   out regularly, yet there is financial uncertainty in the future
   periodical availability of a budget to finance the conservation
   measures. One option to insure against future budget uncertainty is to
   save money. To maximise the long-term survival of the endangered
   species, it has to be decided in each period whether to spend the
   available money now or to allocate it to future use. The paper provides
   an ecological-economic model for this stochastic dynamic optimisation
   problem. The findings include that the available money should be
   allocated as evenly as possible among periods, which may require some
   precautionary saving in early periods to take uncertainty into account.
   Under certain conditions, however, increasing uncertainty may at least
   temporarily increase the optimal payment. Among other parameters, the
   amount of precautionary actions depends on the magnitude of natural
   variation in the species population. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Financing conservation by valuing carbon services produced by wild

Abstract = {Filling the global biodiversity financing gap will require significant
   investments from financial markets, which demand credible valuations of
   ecosystem services and natural capital. However, current valuation
   approaches discourage investment in conservation because their results
   cannot be verified using market-determined prices. Here, we bridge the
   gap between finance and conservation by valuing only wild animals'
   carbon services for which market prices exist. By projecting the future
   path of carbon service production using a spatially explicit demographic
   model, we place a credible value on the carbon capture services produced
   by African forest elephants. If elephants were protected, their services
   would be worth \$20.8 billion (\$10.3 to \$29.7 billion) and \$25.9
   billion (\$12.8 to \$37.6 billion) for the next 10 and 30 y,
   respectively, and could finance anti-poaching and conservation programs.
   Elephant population growth would generate a carbon sink of 109 MtC (64
   to 153) across tropical Africa in the next 30 y. Avoided elephant
   extinction would also prevent the loss of 93 MtC (46 to 130), which is
   the contribution of the remaining populations. Uncertainties in our
   projections are controlled mainly by forest regeneration rates and
   poaching intensity, which indicate that conservation can actively reduce
   uncertainty for increased financial and biodiversity benefits. Our
   methodology can also place lower bounds on the social cost of nature
   degradation. Poaching would result in \$2 to \$7 billion of lost carbon
   services within the next 10 to 30 y, suggesting that the benefits of
   protecting elephants far outweigh the costs. Our methodology enables the
   integration of animal services into global financial markets with major
   implications for conservation, local socioeconomies, and conservation.},

Abstract = {Conservation finance is a nascent field that claims to deliver maximum
   conservation impacts, while, at the same time, generating returns for
   investors (Credit Suisse/WWF). While geographers have questioned the
   ability of conservation finance to play a significant role in
   international biodiversity conservation, an emerging cohort of boutique
   private equity firms are actively generating returns on North American
   conservation projects. This raises the question: how are these firms
   generating profits, and in turn, returns for their shareholders? Drawing
   from a Marxian understanding of finance as redistributive, I argue that
   these firms are generating profits through a process similar to a
   corporate hostile takeover. Using the examples of ranchland and
   timberland investment in the United States, I show that (1) the
   materialities and historical geographies of these landscapes play a
   crucial role their monetization, and (2) shareholder returns are
   generated through a combination of traditional real estate sales and
   revaluations, public monies, and commodity production.},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The role of philanthropic capital in biodiversity conservation is
   rapidly changing. Philanthropists increasingly seek to bankroll
   solutions to the biodiversity crisis, scaling up the size of their
   ambitions and gifts to help close what scientists and policymakers call
   the ``biodiversity financing gap.{''} This paper interrogates the rising
   prominence of philanthropic capital in conservation governance, focusing
   on a class of actors I call ``philanthro-environmentalists.{''} Unlike
   big, international NGOs and philanthrocapitalists,
   philanthro-environmentalists do not engage market-based, for-profit
   approaches to finance conservation. Rather, they engage a ``dollars for
   policy{''} approach that leverages the power of their philanthropy to
   improve public conservation outcomes. Taking Chile as a case, I trace
   how a transnational network of philanthro-environmentalists is using a
   novel mechanism known as Project Finance for Permanence to exact
   substantial political and fiscal commitments from the state in exchange
   for substantive philanthropic support for a mega conservation initiative
   in Chilean Patagonia. I argue that Project Finance for Permanence
   targets policymaking as the primary site of philanthropic intervention,
   affording philanthro-environmentalists greater control over state
   conservation governance. Yet, I also argue that this case raises serious
   questions about the limits and implications of leveraging philanthropic
   capital to solve public environmental problems. Bridging literatures on
   conservation governance and conservation finance, the paper contributes
   new conceptual insights into the evolving dynamics of philanthropy-state
   relations in an age of biodiversity crisis.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-273},

Abstract = {Biodiversity loss is a serious and ongoing global environmental problem.
   Economic instruments in biodiversity policies can contribute towards
   reconciling the conservation costs encountered at local level with the
   benefits of biodiversity conservation at higher levels of governance,
   from regional and national levels up to the global level. This paper
   outlines the theoretical foundations of fiscal transfers in conservation
   policies and also offers a concise account of existing international
   experience and future prospects. The recently amended Portuguese Local
   Finances Law (LFL) of 2007, with its groundbreaking new article on the
   promotion of local sustainability, is analysed in terms of the
   significance of fiscal transfers for municipal budgets. It is compared
   with its predecessor law, highlighting changes in fiscal revenues for
   selected municipalities in the country in relation to their designated
   conservation areas. The analysis shows that these ecological fiscal
   transfers can be significant for those municipalities with a large
   proportion of land under protected status. However, because it also
   introduces a considerable number of changes to the Portuguese fiscal
   transfer scheme, the ecological impact of the new LFL is difficult to
   grasp due to the presence of several crossover effects. The results
   obtained offer significant insights both for improving the Portuguese
   LFL and for designing new ecological fiscal transfer schemes. (C) 2011

Abstract = {This paper examines the costs and benefits of a Norwegian energy
   conservation program that provided financial support for investments in
   energy efficiency. Participants in the program included industry,
   commerce, public services and households. Evaluation of the program
   shows that about 70\% of the participants were `'free riders'' who would
   have invested in efficiency improvements even in the absence of the
   program. The economic efficiency was further reduced by economic
   distortions caused by taxes needed to finance the program. However, the
   energy savings did give environmental benefits through reduced
   atmospheric emissions, although this effect was somewhat diluted through
   a `'conservation rebound,'' where the actual reduction in energy
   consumption was less than the theoretical savings. The energy
   conservation program is also highly sensitive to assumptions about the
   economic lifetime of the investments.},

Abstract = {A financial cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on differentsoil
   conservation practices that have been studied on experimental plots in
   northern Thailand since 1989. Only one system, intercropping coffee with
   rice, has given a positive net present value (NPV) when a 26\% discount
   rate was used, reflecting the annual interest charged on loans within
   villages. A sensitivity analysis shows that another system, hillside
   ditches with coffee trees, and rice as a main crop, can also give a
   positive NPV, but only when a 0\% discount rate is used. It is argued
   that, in the context of agricultural sustainability, parameters other
   than the NPV should also be considered when selecting soil conservation
   practices for extension programs. When all the practices are compared,
   using criteria such as productivity, production risk, environmental
   protection, economic viability, and social acceptability, the
   intercropping system compares favorably with the others. These results
   are in accordance with field observations which showed that
   intercropping perennial crops with annual crops is, for the moment, one
   of the few adaptations that farmers in the study area are willing to
   make to their land and crop management systems.},

Abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and through
   the conservation, sustainable management, and enhancement of carbon
   stocks (REDD+) offers unprecedented potential funding for forest
   conservation and associated biodiversity. However, as a growing number
   of biodiversity conservation projects link with carbon emissions
   mitigation efforts, they might also be exposed to significant financial
   risks. REDD+ projects currently face uncertainty over future demand for
   carbon credits, the potential for inconsistent donor support in the

   emissions mitigation over cobenefits, and the possibility of a
   short-lived REDD+ mechanism. The private sector is aware of the
   associated financial risks, which remain largely unaddressed within the

   a balance between maximizing near-term REDD+ opportunities and
   insulating themselves from long-term financial risks. We describe some
   of the prospective financial risks for biodiversity conservation efforts

Abstract = {It is generally recognized that addressing the ongoing loss of global
   biodiversity requires a substantial increase in funding for conservation
   activities, particularly in developing countries. An increasing interest
   in Payment Mechanisms for Ecosystem Services (PES) begs the question of
   whether a focus on developing payment mechanisms will also reduce the
   ongoing loss of global biodiversity. We review, firstly, current flows
   of funds for biodiversity conservation, including PES and other market
   mechanisms, and secondly, the opportunities and constraints of PES to
   contribute to biodiversity protection globally. We argue that PES can
   and should make an important contribution, but that it will not be
   sufficient to rely on PES alone to finance the actions necessary to
   substantially reduce biodiversity loss. In response to the identified
   constraints, we believe there is a need to develop additional funding
   mechanisms specifically targeted at biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Financial barriers and opportunities for conservation adoption on US

   NRCS-sponsored Greater Sage-grouse habitat conservation programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {329},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S. support ranching livelihoods
   and imperiled populations of the Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus). Incentive-based conservation such as cost-sharing is the
   primary tool used by the federal government to support conservation
   practices on rangelands in the U.S. Financial support for adopting
   specific prescribed grazing practices on private land has been supported
   through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources
   Conservation Service (NRCS)-led Sage-Grouse Initiative (SGI), initiated
   in 2010 as an unparalleled private and public effort to conserve Greater
   Sage-grouse habitat. The purpose of this research was to provide an
   economic assessment of the impact of this conservation program on
   participating ranches. Representative ranch enterprise budgets and ranch
   economic models were created for this analysis for eleven NRCS Major
   Land Resource Areas where critical sage-grouse habitat exist, including
   parts of Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming.
   Results of the economic assessment showed that SGI/NRCS financial
   support alleviated the financial impact of conservation practice
   adoption, but negative financial im-pacts were estimated in some
   locations and more frequently for smaller ranches. Larger ranches were
   found to do better under these programs on average. Results demonstrate
   the important role of research and government financial support in
   removing financial barriers to conservation adoption on rangelands.},

Title = {Financing watershed conservation: Lessons from Ecuador's evolving water
   trust funds},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {145},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {39-49},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In early 2000, the city of Quito, Ecuador, established the Water
   Protection Fund (FONAG) to provide sustainable financing for the
   management and conservation of surrounding watersheds. FONAG was
   innovative in that it pioneered the use of trust funds in a voluntary,
   decentralized mechanism for financing watershed conservation. Since
   then, at least 15 water trust funds have been created or are under
   development in the Northern Andes, seven of which are in Ecuador.
   Ecuador's later water funds share many similarities with FONAG, but
   there are also important differences. This article analyzes the
   evolution of Ecuador's water trust funds since the creation of FONAG. It
   does so by comparing the development and effects-to-date of two of the
   most-recent Ecuadorian water funds: the Fund for Paramo Management and
   Fight Against Poverty in Tungurahua and the Regional Water Fund
   (FORAGUA). The article compares these newer water trust funds with FONAG
   and early payment for environmental services programs to identify four
   lessons regarding the financing of watershed conservation and related
   changes in community-level watershed management within Ecuador. The
   evolution of Ecuador's water trust funds highlights their ability to
   adapt to different socio-cultural and political conditions, including
   those that oppose the commodification of natural resources. As such,
   water funds provide an innovative model for providing sustainable
   financing for watershed conservation in countries like Ecuador where
   privatization is not possible for either legal or cultural reasons. (C)

Abstract = {How to understand the marriage between accumulation and conservation?
   The paper draws from extensive research into one value chain, from the
   advisor in New York City to a wildlife-friendly cattle business in
   Kenya. Making this enterprise return in money requires intimate and
   relentless efforts to transform wasteful conduct across a range of
   institutions and people; we focus on the attempted production of NGO
   economicus, homo economicus plus, and bos Taurus economicus. Drawing
   from feminist and postcolonial theorists of capitalism, we emphasise how
   green capitalist value production does not always hinge on extinguishing
   other-than-capitalist-social relations but rather attempts to mobilise
   and harness such differences, including non-profit-seeking values,
   logics and relations. The paper concludes by reflecting on the temporal
   challenges facing for-profit conservation finance, including those posed
   by previous regimes of accumulation that it relies on but also wants to
   overcome.},

   Ampat, Indonesia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {181-188},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Worldwide, the growth of marine tourism is creating opportunities for
   financing marine protected areas (MPAs), but what these financial
   arrangements look like and how they can be governed at larger scales,
   and in equitable and transparent ways, is unclear. This paper examines
   the governance arrangement of two region wide successive entrance fee
   systems established since 1997 in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, to finance a
   network of MPAs delineated under the auspices of two big international
   non-governmental organizations (NGO), namely Raja Ampat Entrance Fee and
   Raja Ampat Ecosystem Service Stewardship Fee. These two successive
   entrance fee systems can be viewed as payment for environmental services
   (PES) arrangements. The PES-like entrance fee arrangements improved in
   terms of participation, transparency and equity. In the second scheme,
   local communities in Raja Ampat were involved in the design of the
   disbursement of the community fund, and the criteria for disbursement
   became more clear and transparent. However, in both schemes there is no
   clear connection between the distribution of the funds and activities
   that improve environmental services provision (conditionality). In
   addition, the latter scheme is still facing equity challenges as Some
   communities with customary rights over marine tourism hotspots are
   asking for additional user-fees from tourists and tourism operators.},

Abstract = {Given the considerable popularity of community-based wildlife management
   as a conservation tool, it is of interest to assess the long-run
   sustainability of this policy not only in conservation terms, but also
   in financial terms. In this paper, we use cost-benefit analysis to study
   the social and financial sustainability of a large set of community
   conservancies in Namibia, one of the few countries where community-based
   wildlife management policies have been in place long enough to assess
   their long-term viability. We find that, although the social
   sustainability is generally good, the financial sustainability is
   problematic - especially for the younger conservancies: there is no real
   link between conservation achievements and financial success. This calls
   into question the long-term sustainability of many of these
   conservancies: if they are unable to generate enough revenue to pay for
   their running expenditure, they will eventually fail - even if they are
   successful from a conservation point of view. Similar problems, linked
   to the way in which external funders have pushed for additional
   conservancies to be established regardless of financial considerations,
   are likely to be present in other countries that have implemented such
   programmes.

Title = {Marine conservation finance: The need for and scope of an emerging field},

Abstract = {The global oceans contribute to human wellbeing by providing marine
   ecosystermservices, but the ability of the oceans to continue providing
   these services is jeopardised by anthropogenic impacts. There is a limit
   to marine conservation that has not been adequately addressed: finance.
   This paper reviews the state of marine conservation funding, identifies
   associated challenges, and recommends possible ways forward. We identify
   five challenges: 1) funding for marine conservation is inadequate in
   terms of the size, duration, and diversity of revenue, 2) finance
   mechanisms are under-developed and under-utilised, 3) finance is often
   disconnected from conservation planning, 4) the environmental
   side-effects of economic activity increase the gap in global
   conservation funding, and 5) few individuals and programmes specialise
   in marine conservation finance and integrate its disparate lines of
   thinking. We then propose five solutions: 1) financial strategies for
   marine conservation, 2) increased research on and development of finance
   mechanisms, 3) integration of financial planning into conservation
   planning, 4) engagement of businesses in reducing the gap in
   conservation funding for marine ecosystems, and 5) definition, focus,
   and specialists for the emerging field of marine conservation finance.
   Multi-sector and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to reduce
   the marine conservation-funding gap and sustain marine ecosystem
   services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Locating financial incentives among diverse motivations for long-term
   private land conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {A variety of policy instruments are used to promote the conservation of
   biodiversity on private land. These instruments are often employed in
   unison to encourage land stewardship beneficial for biodiversity across
   a broad range of program types, but questions remain about which
   instruments are the appropriate tools when seeking long-term change to
   land-management practice. Drawing on three case studies, two in
   Australia and one in South Africa, spanning various program types-a
   biodiverse carbon planting scheme, a covenanting program, and a
   voluntary stewardship program-we investigate the importance of financial
   incentives and other mechanisms from the landholder's perspective. From
   participant interviews we find that landholders have preconceived
   notions of stewardship ethics. Motivations to enroll into a private land
   conservation program are not necessarily what drives ongoing
   participation, and continued delivery of multiple mechanisms will likely
   ensure long-term landholder engagement. Financial incentives are
   beneficial in lowering uptake costs to landholders but building
   landholder capacity, management assistance, linking participants to a
   network of conservation landholders, and recognition of conservation
   efforts may be more successful in fostering long-term biodiversity
   stewardship. Furthermore, we argue that diverse, multiple instrument
   approaches are needed to provide the flexibility required for dynamic,
   adaptive policy responses. We raise a number of key considerations for
   conservation organizations regarding the appropriate mix of financial
   and nonfinancial components of their programs to address long-term
   conservation objectives.},

Abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is
   a conservation finance instrument based on the payments for ecosystem

   holders, and/or communities are compensated for undertaking activities
   which mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from forest use and land use
   change. This article reviews the numerous sources for REDD+ finance
   within the context of total global conservation finance. In 2013, there
   were approximately 47 REDD+ projects conserving nearly 20 million ha
   with a total transacted value in carbon offset credits estimated to be
   US\$98.8 million. Scaling up conservation financing instruments,
   particularly REDD+, is critical to halting tropical deforestation and
   reversing the trend of global climate change. Although the bulk of REDD+
   financing, especially for capacity building efforts, comes from public
   sector channels, this article discusses five opportunities for private
   sector firms to support REDD+: a firm can develop their own project; a
   firm can donate unrestricted funds to a nonprofit organization; a firm
   can invest in a for-profit firm; a firm can choose to support a
   particular REDD+ project; or a firm can invest into a dedicated fund.},

   Meanwhile, technological progress and industrial structure upgrading are
   important influencing channels. In addition, the marginal impact of
   financial structure on energy conservation and emission reduction is in
   the dynamic evolution process. The study suggests that the financial
   structure is of great significance for energy conservation and emission

Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {139-149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Soil erosion by water is a major threat to food security, environmental
   sustainability and prospects for rural development in Ethiopia.
   Successive governments have promoted various soil and water conservation
   (SWC) measures in order to reduce the effects of land degradation, but
   adoption rates vary considerably. The profitability of SWC measures is
   an essential condition for their adoption. The objective of this
   research was to determine the economic efficiency of three different
   types of SWC technologies (soil bunds, stone bunds and fanya juu) in the
   watersheds of Debre Mewi and Anjeni in the northwestern Ethiopian
   highlands. A farm household survey was carried out among 60 farmers in
   both watersheds and the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was used to
   assess erosion risk on farmers' fields. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
   was then carried out to determine the profitability of the measures
   under different conditions. Erosion estimates for the fields suggest
   that adapted SWC structures were successful in reducing soil erosion.
   The cost-benefit analysis indicates that all SWC measures are profitable
   under `standard' conditions, except soil bunds in Anjeni without grass
   cover. However, the study shows that different underlying assumptions
   change the CBA results considerably and consequently also change the
   conclusions regarding circumstances under which SWC measures are or are
   not profitable. This illustrates the volatility of the profitability of
   SWC measures. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Paying resource users to preserve features of their environment could in
   theory better align production and conservation goals. We show, however,
   that across a range of conservation dilemmas, they might not. We conduct
   a synthesis of dynamic games experiments built around collective action
   dilemmas in conservation, played across Europe, Africa, and Asia. We
   find, across this range of dilemmas, that while payments can encourage
   pro-conservation behavior, they often fail to capitalize on the
   potential for jointly improving productive and environmental outcomes,
   highlighting the more nuanced challenge of reconciling livelihoods with
   conservation goals. We further find production (yield) and the joint
   production-environment product (i.e., a measure of agricultural
   production multiplied by a measure of pro-conservation practice) are
   better preserved in groups that are more educated, more gender diverse
   and that better represent women. We discuss how the design of incentive
   programs can better align livelihood and environment goals.
   A series of dynamic games built around collective action dilemmas in
   conservation suggest that payments to encourage conservation often fail
   to jointly improve agricultural production and environmental outcomes,
   but are more successful in more educated and gender diverse groups.},

Abstract = {Environmental politics in the United States have become inseparable from
   the politics of guns. The Pittman-Robertson Act of 1937 transformed
   conservation policy and funding in the United States, establishing the
   Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Account, which generates public
   revenue for conservation through a tax on firearms, ammunition, and
   archery equipment. As the manufacture and purchase of firearms and
   ammunition have increased rapidly in recent years, the funds flowing to
   conservation have also grown. Despite allotting more than USD750 million
   to states in 2020 alone, the Pittman-Robertson Act has been overlooked
   in discussions of the political economy of conservation. Here, we
   compare the four largest sources of revenue for state wildlife and
   conservation agencies and demonstrate the growing importance of
   Pittman-Robertson as gun sales increase. We argue that the position of
   firearms in conservation has shifted, disrupting widely held ideals of
   conservation and undermining the `user pays' model that is argued to
   undergird conservation activities in the United States. We explore the
   ethical concerns produced by this emerging relationship and the ways
   Pittman-Robertson entangles conservation with guns and violence.},

Title = {Evaluating the Financial Effectiveness of Funded Projects on Tiger
   Conservation in Bangladesh},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background and Research AimsThe conservation of Bengal tigers is a
   global concern due to their exponential decline in population around the
   world. In 2010, all Tiger Range Countries (TRCs) committed to double
   their tiger population by 2022. As a member of the TRCs, Bangladesh has
   launched and conducted many tiger conservation projects with a heavy
   financial investment. However, the tiger population has not increased in
   the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate why those
   funded projects' outcomes were unsatisfactory compared to neighboring
   countries such as India and Nepal.MethodsThis review was conducted
   purely based on previous archival tiger conservation related documents.
   Six specific tiger conservation projects implemented in Bangladesh,
   India, and Nepal were selected to investigate the effectiveness of tiger
   conservation in Bangladesh. Allocated fund distributions were segmented
   into five groups: capacity building, planning policy and reports,
   infrastructural development, tiger-human conflict (THC) reduction, and
   in-field actions to increase the tiger population.ResultsThe analysis
   showed that India and Nepal spent most of their budget on in-field
   activities and least on planning. A moderate amount was spent on THC
   reduction, capacity building, and infrastructural development. In
   contrast, Bangladesh spent the majority of its fund on planning. India
   and Nepal also developed a sustainable funding mechanism to reduce their
   dependency on donor agencies, which was absent in the case of
   Bangladesh.ConclusionIt is recommended that future tiger conservation
   initiatives in Bangladesh should address more in-field action, such as
   patrolling to stop poaching and the illegal extraction of resources,
   sustainable long-term alternative income generation activities, and
   health issues such as identifying diseases, inbreeding effects, and
   captive breeding.Implications for ConservationBangladesh needs to
   develop a sustainable long-term funding mechanism for in-field actions
   for tiger protection.},

Title = {Financing marine conservation from restructured debt: a case study of
   the Seychelles},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {In the face of the threats posed to the oceans by a changing climate,
   the need for marine conservation programs grows rapidly. Scaling with
   this need demands sufficient funding to support ambitious conservation
   projects. This funding must be obtained from increasingly varied and
   innovative sources since private grants and government allocated funds
   has proved insufficient. Debt-for-nature swaps are a financial mechanism
   seeking to improve debt burden while setting up environmental programs.
   This method of debt restructuring has existed for decades, but is seeing
   a resurgence of use and interest in recent years. Here we present an
   exploratory case study of a Seychelles debt-for-nature swap which
   examines this financial mechanism's ability to fund impactful
   conservation projects, particularly in marine Economic Exclusion Zones
   (EEZ) of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The Seychelles finalized
   a conversion of their sovereign debt with Paris Club creditors and The
   Nature Conservancy as a broker in 2015 with the goal of creating a
   robust marine spatial plan (MSP). They received notable recognition for
   multiple novel aspects of this deal as well as the sheer scale of the
   marine space protected (400,000 sq. km), and thus serves as a robust
   case study to analyze if debt-for-nature swaps have evolved since its
   theoretical conception in 1984. Our research favors qualitative data by
   employing a case study approach which draws on semi-structured
   interviews with key informants, content analysis of online resources,
   and a literature review. This research suggests that while the model has
   yet to be cemented, the Seychelles case study is representative of a
   coming evolution in debt-for-nature swap practices. By examining the
   critical governance factors that were employed in the Seychelles, this
   research reveals key takeaways for future implementation and
   establishing national candidacy. The findings highlight debt status
   relative to the economy, political willpower, funding streams utilized,
   and the use of co-production practices. We show how the Seychelles case
   study demonstrates marked progress from the historical standard
   regarding sovereignty concerns and governance, but not concerning
   timescales and low converted sum. However, we note that this innovative
   debt-for-nature swap suggests that a new standard is possible and
   provides a new framework and set of best practices. In doing so, the
   Seychelles MSP can potentially lead the way for additional marine
   debt-for-nature swaps.},

Title = {Conservation finance: What are we not doing? A review and research
   agenda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {336},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Conservation finance embraces a series of innovative financing
   mechanisms aimed at raising and managing capital to be used for the
   conservation of biodiversity. The climate emergency and the pursuit of
   sustainable development underline the criticality of financial support
   for achieving this goal. Funding for the protection of biodiversity, in
   fact, has long been disbursed by governments in a residual form, only
   after they have dealt with social needs and political challenges. To
   date, the main challenge of conservation finance is to identify
   solutions that not only generate new revenue for biodiversity, but also
   effectively manage and allocate existing funding to provide a mix of
   social and community benefits as well. The paper, therefore, aims to act
   as a wake-up call, urging academics working in economics and finance to
   turn their attention to resolving the financial problems faced by
   conservation. Through a comparative bibliometric analysis, the study
   aims to outline the structure of scientific research on the topic of
   conservation finance, to understand the state of the art, and to
   identify open questions and new research trends. The results of the
   study show that the topic of conservation finance is currently a
   prerogative of scholars and journals of ecology, biology and
   environmental sciences. Finance scholars pay very little attention to
   the topic and yet there are many opportunities/needs for future
   research. The results are of interest to researchers in banking and
   finance, policy-makers and managers.},

Abstract = {In the USA, endangered species are federally protected under the
   Endangered Species Act. Yet they can be harmed under the condition that
   impacts on their habitats are mitigated. This is known as the no-net
   loss principle. To do so, public regulators acknowledge conservation
   banks and endangered species credit production as the most robust policy
   instruments, as they allow for ecological restoration ahead of impacts.
   The aim of this paper is to show how endangered species credits, as
   `environmental intangibles,' are designed and produced so as to meet two
   diverging objectives, that is, ensuring permanent conservation and
   attracting private investors. Permanent conservation is ensured through
   financial insurances, which tie environmental intangibles to a very
   tangible asset, land. Therefore, environmental credit-making is not only
   a matter of scientific measurement; as commodities crafted out of
   government regulation, environmental intangibles also need to be legally
   stabilized, including through the use of property and financial tools.
   This securement entails important production costs that limit investors'
   profits. Environmental field-level bureaucrats play a central role in
   understanding this tension, as they organize trade-offs between finance
   and conservation temporality so as to ensure the production of
   environmental intangibles permanently linked to land and ecosystems.},

Title = {Financial compensation for biodiversity conservation in Ba Be National
   Park of Northern Vietnam},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {92-100},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Terrestrial biodiversity is seriously threatened by an increasing
   deforestation rate. Financial incentives can stimulate local people to
   participate in biodiversity conservation. A common approach to derive
   financial compensation is estimating the opportunity costs arising from
   the adoption of conservation friendly land-use practices. Assuming that
   farmers are risk averse, we used a decision-making under uncertainty
   approach to derive financial compensation for local people living in and
   around Ba Be National Park, Vietnam. Moderately risk-averse farmers need
   US\$ 228 ha(-1) year(-1) financial compensation for the protection of
   natural forests in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones,
   whereas the required compensation reaches US\$ 334 ha(-1) year(-1) in
   the Strict Protection Zone. These compensation payments were derived by
   comparing financial returns from natural forests with those of the most
   profitable land use (maize). Compensation amounts decrease to US\$ 130
   ha-(1) year(-1) in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones and to
   US\$ 218 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone, when considering
   diversification strategy. Derived financial compensations assume that
   farms comprise 20\% croplands and 80\% forest. We conclude that
   compensation amounts vary with farmers' risk preferences, whether or not
   diversification strategy is considered, and the level of protection of a
   given area. 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Conservation and Unscripted Development: Proximity to Park Associated
   with Development and Financial Diversity},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Decades of research on the social dynamics of biodiversity conservation
   has shown that parks and protected areas have added hardship to rural
   communities throughout much of the developing world. Nonetheless, some
   recent studies have found evidence of poverty alleviation near protected
   areas. To build on these conflicting accounts, I use a comparative,
   mixed-methods design to examine opportunistic, unplanned, i.e.,
   unscripted, development in indigenous communities near Tarangire
   National Park (TNP) in northern Tanzania. I ask the questions: (1) How
   is proximity to TNP related to community-level infrastructural
   development? (2) How has the process of development changed over time?
   and (3) How is proximity to TNP related to infrastructure-related social
   outcomes at the household-level? Results from semistructured interviews
   show that, compared with distant communities, communities near TNP have
   developed more extensive education and water infrastructure in the past
   decade by procuring financial support from a greater diversity of
   external organizations, including wildlife-related organizations.
   Correspondingly, household survey results show that education measures
   are positively associated with proximity to TNP, controlling for other
   factors. These findings support the notion that development can accrue
   near protected areas in ways that are diverse, uncoordinated, and
   opportunistic, and correspondingly distinct from heralded
   community-based conservation, community-based natural resource
   management, and integrated conservation and development project
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {The resources invested by the forest owner in the nature conservation of
   the forest depend on the level of nature conservation, the efficiency of
   the production and the distribution of costs between the forest owner
   and other groups. The level of nature conservation is increasing Ly the
   change of values outside but also inside forestry, whereas a reduction
   of the level is caused by the reorganization of the state owned forests.
   The increase of the efficiency in securing nature values in the forest
   helps forestry to bring the costs down. This carl be achieved by
   integrating the god of nature conservation into multifunctional forestry
   and by cooperation with new environmentalist experts. The forest owner
   could get additional financial resources for nature values of his forest
   by selling new non-wood products. But such redistributional policy
   causes a lot more conflicts than the more traditional resistance of
   forestry against increasing the standards in nature conservation. A new
   active and less conflictional forest policy could focus on increasing
   the efficiency of multiple use forestry including nature values.},

Title = {Shark-diving tourism as a financing mechanism for shark conservation
   strategies in Malaysia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {220-226},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study estimated the economic value of the shark-diving industry in
   Semporna, the most popular diving destination of Malaysia, by surveying
   the expenditures of diving tourists and dive operators through the
   region. A willingness-to-pay survey was also used to estimate the
   potential of the industry as a financing mechanism for enforcement and
   management of a hypothetical Marine Protected Area (MPA) to conserve
   shark populations. The study showed that in 2012, shark-diving tourism
   provided direct revenues in excess of USD 9.8 million to the Semporna
   region. These economic benefits had a flow-on effect, generating more
   than USD 2 million in direct taxes to the government and USD 1.4 million
   in salaries to the community. A contingent valuation analysis indicated
   that implementation of a fee paid by divers could generate over USD 2
   million for management and enforcement of the MPA each year. These
   findings suggest that shark diving is an important contributor to the
   economy of the Semporna region that could be used as a mechanism to
   assist financial resourcing for management and conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {World governments have committed to halting human-induced extinctions
   and safeguarding important sites for biodiversity by 2020, but the
   financial costs of meeting these targets are largely unknown. We
   estimate the cost of reducing the extinction risk of all globally
   threatened bird species (by >= 1 International Union for Conservation of
   Nature Red List category) to be U. S. \$0.875 to \$1.23 billion annually
   over the next decade, of which 12\% is currently funded. Incorporating
   threatened nonavian species increases this total to U. S. \$3.41 to
   \$4.76 billion annually. We estimate that protecting and effectively
   managing all terrestrial sites of global avian conservation significance
   (11,731 Important Bird Areas) would cost U. S. \$65.1 billion annually.
   Adding sites for other taxa increases this to U. S. \$76.1 billion
   annually. Meeting these targets will require conservation funding to
   increase by at least an order of magnitude.},

Title = {Using financial incentives to motivate conservation of an at-risk
   species on private lands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Financial incentives have become a core component of private lands
   conservation programmes because of their ability to motivate stewardship
   behaviour. Concern exists about the durability of stewardship behaviours
   after payments end. Payments for performance may impact farmers' current
   and future engagement with an incentive programme to protect an at-risk
   ground-nesting grassland bird. Farmer motivations for participating in
   the programme, as well as their intention to continue the programme if
   the financial incentive no longer existed, were quantified. Although
   farmers did not report a high level of current involvement in the
   programme, most reported they would continue at a similar or higher
   level of engagement if the payments ended. These outcomes were related
   to their perception that their participation was driven by their
   internal motivation to help rather than the desire to obtain the
   financial reward. The perception that their behaviour was self-directed
   was positively influenced by the flexibility surrounding landowners'
   engagement with the programme, a feeling of competence and achievement,
   and a feeling of connectedness to the organization implementing the
   programme. The success of conservation incentive programmes over the
   long term can be enhanced by explicitly accounting for the needs of
   landowners in programme design and administration.},

Journal = {BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {353-368},

Abstract = {Impact investments have the dual goals of generating profit and
   environmental and/or social impact from the same project or enterprise.
   This article examines recent impact investments in biodiversity
   conservation-specifically, debt finance in the form of conventional
   bonds and impact bonds. The proceeds of these bonds finance projects
   aiming to enhance forest management, sustainable agriculture, endangered
   species protection, ecosystem service provision, and nature-based
   solutions to climate change such as REDD+. The article scrutinises
   whether these dual goals are achievable by evaluating the financial
   risks and impact risks within each bond's theory of change. Risks stem
   from projects with vague cashflow forecasts, project sites with low or
   ambiguous threat statuses, and simplified impact metrics that may
   measure activities or outputs-rather than impact. Risk mitigation
   strategies involve using baselines and counterfactuals to establish
   additionality, and guarantors to protect investors if revenues are
   insufficient. Implications for biodiversity management and for-profit
   conservation are discussed.},

Journal = {GERMANIC REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {108-123},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {In 2019, a new strategy in wildlife conservation was announced:
   so-called ``rhino impact bonds,{''} designed to support the conservation
   of African black rhinos, with the ultimate aim of establishing a global
   ``conservation debt market.{''} This essay takes this development in the
   financialization of wildlife conservation as an object lesson in the
   mutual imbrication of guilt, debt, and the (non)human in the age of the
   Anthropocene. To this end, it traces a theoretical trajectory that
   explicitly frames the figure of ``Man{''} in terms of Schuld, starting
   with Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals. The essay takes Nietzsche's
   ``sovereign individual{''} to refer not to the human species as a whole
   but rather a specific ``genre{''} of the human, namely what Sylvia
   Wynter calls homo oeconomicus. In ``overrepresenting{''} himself as the
   paradigmatic human, this figure has established capital accumulation as
   the goal of all human life. From here, the essay turns to Walter
   Benjamin's characterization of capitalism as a religion whose ultimate
   aim is not salvation but universal debt/guilt, and finally to Adorno's
   account of nature conservation as domination. The rhino bonds represent
   the logical consequence of this trajectory, namely the expansion of the
   principle of universal debt to the entire natural world.},

   Finance: Evidence from China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The energy-saving and low-carbon development model is one of the
   important symbols of high-quality economic development. This article
   attempts to study the environmental effects of green finance from both
   theoretical and empirical perspectives, that is, to test whether green
   finance policies contribute to achieving energy conservation and
   emission reduction. This article is based on provincial panel data from
   2007 to 2020 in China and constructs a dynamic spatial Durbin model to
   examine the impact of green finance on environmental pollution and
   energy intensity. The results indicate that (1) green finance can
   achieve a dual effect of energy conservation and emission reduction
   simultaneously and has a significant promoting effect on energy
   conservation and emission reduction in neighboring regions. This
   conclusion is still valid after conducting robustness tests. (2) The
   energy-saving and emission-reduction effects of green finance exhibit
   significant regional heterogeneity, indicating that the performance of
   green finance is more outstanding in the eastern region with a higher
   level of economic development. (3) Mechanism testing has found that
   green finance can achieve energy-saving and emission-reduction effects
   through four channels: environmental regulation, credit allocation,
   enterprise profits, and enterprise innovation. Therefore, in order to
   further promote high-quality economic development, we need to build a
   comprehensive and multi-level green finance system, enrich the green
   finance policy toolbox, and smooth the transmission channels of green
   finance to promote green and stable economic development.},

Title = {Financial efficiency of major soil and water conservation measures in

Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures are needed to control soil
   erosion and sustain agricultural production on steep slopes of West
   Usambara mountains. However, the adoption by farmers of the recommended
   soil and water conservation measures is low and soil erosion continues
   to be a problem. It could well be that the reason for the low adoption
   is that the costs to invest in soil and water conservation are higher
   than the eventual benefits. This research assessed the costs and
   benefits of bench terraces, grass strips and fanya juu, which are major
   SWC measures. Financial Cost Benefit Analysis (FCBA) was undertaken for
   farmers with low, moderate and high opportunity costs of labour at
   different slopes and soil types. The results show that labour is the
   major cost item in implementing SWC measures and is higher with bench
   terraces than with fanya juu and grass strips. The results also show
   that the costs of establishing the three SWC measures exceed the returns
   in the initial 2 years. However, in the long term, the three SWC
   measures are profitable to farmers with low to medium opportunity costs
   of about on gentle to moderate slopes. It was also found that SWC
   measures are not financially attractive to most farmers with off-farm
   activities and other sources of income. It is concluded that high
   investment costs and initial negative returns are the major hindrances
   to the adoption of SWC measures by smallholder farmers in West Usambara
   mountains. Options to overcome the initial investment costs include the
   gradual investment in SWC measures, introduction of high value crops and
   small credit facilities. The promotion of dairy cattle under zero
   grazing system can also increase the adoption of SWC measures because of
   the high benefits from grasses used to stabilise SWC measures. (c) 2005

Title = {Does financial support for grassland conservation and restoration
   improve ecological benefits? evidence from China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Grassland ecological restoration is an important cornerstone to maintain
   the sustainable development of grassland ecosystem. One of the goals of
   financial support for grassland ecological protection and restoration is
   whether the ecological benefits of grassland are fully realized, and
   grassland vegetation coverage is the main index to measure the
   ecological benefits. This paper aims to analyze whether the financial
   support for grassland ecological protection and restoration has improved
   the vegetation coverage of grassland. and then verify whether there is
   room for improvement in the fiscal effect of grassland ecological
   protection and restoration? Based on the panel data of 54 animal
   husbandry and semi-agricultural and semi-animal husbandry counties in
   Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, this paper adopts a
   bidirectional fixed effect model and cross-fixed effect model to
   introduce natural factors affecting grassland vegetation coverage into
   the model and systematically examines the financial effects of
   ecological benefits of financial support for grassland ecological
   protection and restoration. The main findings are as follows: (1) there
   is a nonlinear relationship between financial support for grassland
   ecological protection and restoration and grassland vegetation coverage
   when natural factors are taken into account in the model. (2) different
   fiscal expenditure structure has a heterogeneous response to the impact
   of grassland ecological protection and restoration on ecological
   benefits. (3) the degree of fiscal decentralization and the relative
   performance of the government have a significant positive moderating
   effect on the ecological benefits of fiscal support for grassland
   ecological protection and restoration.},

Title = {Traps and transformations influencing the financial viability of tourism
   on private-land conservation areas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The ability of private conservation organizations to remain financially
   viable is a key factor influencing their effectiveness. One-third of
   financially motivated private-land conservation areas (PLCAs) surveyed
   in South Africa are unprofitable, raising questions about landowners'
   abilities to effectively adapt their business models to the
   socioeconomic environment. In any complex system, options for later
   adaptation can be constrained by starting conditions (path dependence).
   We tested 3 hypothesized drivers of path dependence in PLCA ecotourism
   and hunting business models: (H1) the initial size of a PLCA limits the
   number of mammalian game and thereby predators that can be sustained;
   (H2) initial investments in infrastructure limit the ability to
   introduce predators; and (H3) rainfall limits game and predator
   abundance. We further assessed how managing for financial stability
   (optimized game stocking) or ecological sustainability (allowing game to
   fluctuate with environmental conditions) influenced the ability to
   overcome path dependence. A mechanistic PLCA model based on simple
   ecological and financial rules was run for different initial conditions
   and management strategies, simulating landowner options for adapting
   their business model annually. Despite attempts by simulated landowners
   to increase profits, adopted business models after 13 years were
   differentiated by initial land and infrastructural assets, supporting H1
   and H2. A conservation organization's initial assets can cause it to
   become locked into a financially vulnerable business model. In our
   50-year simulation, path dependence was overcome by fewer of the
   landowners who facilitated natural ecological variability than those who
   maintained constant hunting rates and predator numbers, but the latter
   experienced unsustainably high game densities in low rainfall years.
   Management for natural variability supported long-term ecological
   sustainability but not shorter term socioeconomic sustainability for
   PLCAs. Our findings highlight trade-offs between ecological and economic
   sustainability and suggest a role for governmental support of the
   private conservation industry.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem service (ES) evidence and arguments can mobilize support for
   biodiversity conservation. However, the ES concept's impact on the
   ground seems unclear: It is reliant upon a range of pre-requisites at
   the science-policy nexus and it tends to be science-driven and demanding
   in terms of data and required capacity. The TEEB stepwise approach (The
   Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Local and Regional Policy
   Makers, Earthscan, London, 2012) guides purpose-driven ES assessments
   and seeks to enhance the usefulness of the ES concept in difficult
   real-world settings. An application of this approach has not yet been
   appraised. Also, beyond the instrumental use of ES data (e.g. for the
   design of payment schemes for ES), there is little documented experience
   with strategically using ES arguments for mobilizing financial resources
   for conservation. As many other countries, Cte d'Ivoire does not have a
   strong knowledge base on ecosystem services (ES). Such circumstances can
   preclude the use of the ES concept for convincing potential donors to
   co-finance conservation. We examine the recent ES assessment for the
   Parc national de Ta < (PNT), Cte d'Ivoire, which followed the TEEB
   stepwise approach. We look at process, results and outcomes to address
   three questions: (i) How did study results contribute to mobilizing
   funds for the PNT? (ii) In which ways was the TEEB stepwise approach
   useful in practice? (iii) What lessons can be drawn for ES assessments
   geared to conservation finance?.},

Abstract = {The environment of a regularly occupied space can be extensively
   improved by maximum utilization of natural light/daylight, which is
   available in abundance. In Indian climate, availability of sufficient
   day light in both direct and diffused form of radiation can lead to
   reduction in dependency on artificial lighting thus, decreasing energy
   demand for artificial lighting system. In this study, an institutional
   building in New Delhi, India is analyzed for its daylighting
   characteristics. The academic block of a building comprising all
   categories of regularly spaces is modeled and simulated using Integrated
   environmental solutions -virtual environment (IES VE). The objective is
   to analyze the extent of penetration of natural light into these spaces
   of the building for reducing energy requirement for artificial lighting
   by studying a room, which performs the worst as per present case
   parameters. The conclusion puts forth the optimal solutions for
   utilizing maximum day light in a work space, complying with standards
   set forth by building construction council by utilizing the principles
   for increasing luminous flux level through visual light transmittance,
   window-to-wall ratio, and controlled usage of artificial lighting.
   Considering all these factors in the analysis, energy savings and carbon
   mitigation due to these savings in regularly occupied spaces are finally
   evaluated.},

   (i.e., charges related to use) and 75 on a fixed tariff (i.e., charges
   unrelated to use). Adopting a social dilemma approach, I expected a
   fixed tariff to be associated with greater use than a variable tariff,
   in particular when resources were valuable and people identified weakly
   with their community. This hypothesis was supported in both the field
   study and an experimental study that simulated a natural resource crisis

Title = {Financial imperative or conservation concern? EU farmers' motivations
   for participation in voluntary agri-environmental schemes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {32},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2161-2185},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based on a large transnational research project that involved
   questionnaires with 1000 farm households in nine EU countries and
   Switzerland, this paper investigates factors influencing farmers'
   participation in agri-environmental schemes (AESs). Analysis of
   motivations for AES participation highlights that complex patterns of
   AESs are in operation. Pronounced geographical differences in farmers'
   reactions towards schemes can be identified, with responses by farmers
   from northern member states often differing from those in Mediterranean
   countries, and with arable farmers often responding differently fi-om
   grassland farmers. Yet, the study also highlights that much common
   ground exists and that conceptual frameworks for the understanding of
   farmers' participation in AESs developed in the United Kingdom can be
   successfully applied outside the British context. Common participation
   patterns include the importance of financial imperatives and `goodness
   of fit: and the influence of similar sets of factors such as farm size,
   tenure, or farm type. The growing importance of conservation-oriented
   motivations for AES participation across Europe suggests the emergence
   of a `new hypothesis' which highlights that the financial imperative for
   participation does not necessarily exclude an often equally important
   environmental concern. The paper concludes by indicating where current
   agri-environmental policy (AEP) may be failing adequately to address
   structural and socioeconomic characteristics of targeted farming
   populations, and by arguing that understanding participation
   decisionmaking is only the first step in an attempt to assess the
   `effectiveness' of AEP. Further comparative research is needed to
   investigate in detail more complex indicators of scheme success, in
   particular what effects scheme participation has on farmers' incomes,
   farmers' environmental attitudes, and on the environmental quality of
   the countryside targeted by AESs.},

Title = {Integrating Conservation and Financial Objectives on Private Rangelands
   in Northern Colorado: Rancher and Practitioner Perceptions},
Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {330-338},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services and other approaches seek to expand
   conservation outcomes from working ranches in rangeland systems. Making
   these strategies attractive to ranchers and effective in achieving
   conservation goals requires information that is largely lacking about
   the human dimensions of aligning conservation, agricultural, and
   financial objectives on working ranches. This exploratory study
   addressed this knowledge gap about perceived strategies, barriers, and
   opportunities by interviewing a purposive sample of 23 ranchers and
   natural resource practitioners (e.g., government agencies, conservation
   nonprofits) involved in a collaborative stakeholder group in Larimer
   County, Colorado. Interviewees' responses demonstrated a wide range of
   potential strategies for ranchers to adopt, yet their discussion of
   ranch-scale and regional concerns demonstrated the multiple interlinked
   ecological, financial, and social factors that pose challenges for
   mainstreaming opportunities. All interviewees expressed interest in
   developing a regional payment for ecosystem services program, seeing an
   opportunity to simultaneously support ranchers and improve conservation
   stewardship. However, substantial concerns were expressed regarding
   possible restrictions to the ranch operation, profitability, and other
   management and legal factors that would diminish attractiveness to
   ranchers. Our findings suggest that characteristics of our study system,
   including proximity to urban areas and the presence of a collaborative
   stakeholder group, contribute importantly to the opportunities and
   challenges perceived by interviewees. Furthermore, interviewees'
   responses highlighted how factors beyond the ranch-scale can affect the
   viability of ranch business strategies to achieve conservation and
   agricultural objectives. Future research with representative populations
   across rangeland systems in the American West and in contexts with and
   without collaborative groups will build constructively upon this
   exploratory study.},

Title = {Measuring the financial sustainability of vine landraces for better
   conservation programmes of Mediterranean agro-biodiversity},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Abstract = {The Apulia region, in southern Italy, has a long tradition of vine
   cultivation for winemaking. However, in the last decades, regional
   farmers substituted local landraces with more productive non-native
   varieties. Regional institutions introduced regulations aimed at
   preventing the extinction of the local and historic ecotypes in the form
   of financial subsidies to reduce planting and operating costs.
   In this paper, we compared the financial sustainability of a
   non-autochthone, a typical and a landrace variety for wine production,
   in intensive and semi-extensive cultivation systems, with and without
   financial supports. The analysis referred to northern Apulia,
   considering a 26-year economic duration of vineyards. The results showed
   that the non-autochthone variety was more profitable due to its higher
   yields, while investments regarding landrace-based plants were
   characterized by lower economic convenience, despite financial aid.
   These estimates shed light on the effectiveness and efficacy of the
   present regulations, as well as on the development of future strategies
   for a better restoration of vine landraces in Apulia. This new framework
   will help to increase fanners' profits, improve environmental conditions
   for the community and ensure higher quality, security and safety for
   consumers.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in biodiversity conservation today is how
   to facilitate protection of species that are highly valued at a global
   scale but have little or even negative value at a local scale. Imperiled
   species such as large predators can impose significant economic costs at
   a local level, often in poverty-stricken rural areas where households
   are least able to tolerate such costs, and impede efforts of local
   people, especially traditional pastoralists, to escape from poverty.
   Furthermore, the costs and benefits involved in predator conservation
   often include diverse dimensions, which are hard to quantify and nearly
   impossible to reconcile with one another. The best chance of effective
   conservation relies upon translating the global value of carnivores into
   tangible local benefits large enough to drive conservation ``on the
   ground.{''} Although human-carnivore coexistence involves significant
   noneconomic values, providing financial incentives to those affected
   negatively by carnivore presence is a common strategy for encouraging
   such coexistence, and this can also have important benefits in terms of
   reducing poverty. Here, we provide a critical overview of such financial
   instruments, which we term ``payments to encourage coexistence{''};
   assess the pitfalls and potentials of these methods, particularly
   compensation and insurance, revenue-sharing, and conservation payments;
   and discuss how existing strategies of payment to encourage coexistence
   could be combined to facilitate carnivore conservation and alleviate
   local poverty.},

Abstract = {In a 500-household pilot, we tested an innovative approach to water
   demand management, implemented in collaboration with a water utility in
   a large city in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We
   provided a novel intervention, called a Water Savings Credit (WSC),
   which granted participants volumetric rebates on their water bills for
   their reductions in water consumption. WSCs were effective at
   encouraging conservation in our pilot in Marrakech. Our approach has the
   benefits of a price incentive, without the political risk of a tariff
   increase. For urban water utilities that provide highly subsidized
   services, this approach could ultimately pay for itself, or potentially
   result in net financial savings. Our approach may be especially
   effective in the countries of the MENA region, as the region has a high
   rate of subsidization for water services, and because it is facing
   increasing water scarcity from economic growth, urbanization, and
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the fundamental principle of conservation of
   physical money of the global financial system that guarantees its
   equilibrium and stability. Similar to the principle of conservation of
   mass-energy systems and based on the commodity money concept, then the
   physical money cannot be created from nullity nor can be destroyed. As a
   result, violation of such a system will lead to a deficit in the
   financial system which cannot be paid off. Additionally, violation of
   gold standard and the breakage of the Bretton Woods system are the
   reason behind the current world financial crisis. Paying interest on
   money loans will violate this principle as well. The international
   banking system is volatile and over-valued since it is based on the
   fractional banking technique that banks do not actually need to have the
   money to back up the deposits their clients have made into their
   accounts. Instead, the banks are required only to keep a small fraction
   of such deposits on hand. Moreover The Bank of International Settlements
   (BIS) in Switzerland has recently reported that global outstanding
   derivatives have reached 1.14 quadrillion dollars: \$548 Trillion in
   listed credit derivatives plus \$596 trillion in notional OTC
   derivatives. Furthermore, by 2007 credit default swap total value has
   dramatically increased to an estimated \$45 trillion to \$62 trillion.
   Additionally, subprime mortgage crisis, credit crisis and banking
   closure all have resulted from the violation of conservation money.
   Taking into the account that the World's GDPs for all nations is
   approximately \$50 trillion and all of the asset value of the world is
   only \$190 Trillion, it can be seen easily that the \$1140 trillion
   financial derivatives system will lead in the near future to the
   collapse of the international financial system.},

Abstract = {Historic Herff Farm in Boerne, Texas is an iconic Texas Hill Country
   landscape that has been carefully restored by the Cibolo Nature Center
   and Farm and is now being transformed into a center for sustainable
   living. In 2016, the farm was recognized with a Preservation Texas Honor
   Award, and the homestead is listed on the National Register of Historic
   Places. A new Texas Historical Commission marker celebrates the life of
   the farm's namesake, Dr. Ferdinand Ludwig von Herff, a prominent San
   Antonio physician who emigrated from Germany in the mid-1800s. Taking
   cues from its past, Herff Farm is a destination that currently hosts a
   weekly farmers market, ``Farm Classroom{''} for schoolchildren in the
   area, with demonstrations showcasing best practices for water
   conservation, renewable energy and small-scale agricultural production.
   This paper highlights financial, legal and programmatic strategies that
   have been utilized to conserve the property in perpetuity. The Texas
   Historic Preservation Tax Credit was established by the Texas
   Legislature in 2015 for certified rehabilitation work on
   historically-designated properties and equals 25\% of eligible costs and
   expenses. This is a valuable financial tool for owners and investors who
   wish to rehabilitate cultural treasures to the Standards of
   Rehabilitation of the Secretary of the Interior. The property has also
   been placed under a voluntary conservation easement, a legal agreement
   between the landowner and a land trust that limits the owner's
   development rights in order to maintain its natural and cultural
   features. Finally, building public support by providing access, services
   and programs helps ensure a culture of stewardship and sense of
   ownership by the greater community. These strategies could be employed
   by conservation-minded landowners with limited resources who seek to
   preserve cultural and natural resources.},

Title = {Conservation at a crossroads: governing by global targets, innovative
   financing, and techno-optimism or radical reform?},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation is at a crossroads. A number of trends are
   converging with the potential to transform our understanding of nature
   and how we conserve it. First, conservation policy makers are advocating
   increasingly ambitious global biodiversity targets, such as the
   agreement to protect 30\% of terrestrial, inland water, and of coast and
   marine areas by 2030 made at the December 2022 Conference of the Parties
   to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Second, recognizing that
   governments do not have sufficient resources to reach these ambitious
   targets, they are turning to private finance and innovative financing
   mechanisms for help. Third, technological advances are enabling new ways
   of surveilling people, species, and ecosystems, measuring conservation
   outcomes, and targeting funding. Finally, long-standing concerns over
   the alienation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities from land and
   resources, and the colonial legacy of conservation, have been amplified
   by widespread contemporary awareness of racism more generally. Nascent
   critiques of conservation are incorporating but also moving beyond calls
   for participatory or rights-based approaches to conservation to push for
   the complete decolonization of conservation, alternatives to capitalist
   approaches to conservation, and other radical reforms. Collectively,
   these shifts are both reinforcing traditional conservation practice and
   power relationships and opening up space to expand understandings of
   collaborative management, environmental caretaking, and sustainable
   livelihoods and dramatically reform conservation. In this article, we
   draw on decades of research studying conservation governance in sites
   that range from villages to international meetings in order to examine
   this critical historical moment in conservation politics. We argue that
   conservation is at an ontological and epistemic moment during which the
   meaning of biodiversity, how to know it, how to conserve it, and who
   should conserve it is being fundamentally transformed. As transnational
   movements seek to transform our political economic system and to
   decolonize conservation, the consolidation of elite power among actors
   in finance, technology, governments, and big nongovernmental
   organizations abstracts conservation from localized contexts, drawing
   attention away from ensuring effective conservation on the ground and
   failing to challenge the root causes of biodiversity loss. Thus,
   continued vigilance is needed to keep equity, rights, justice, and
   livelihoods at the forefront of conservation.},

Title = {Experimental evidence for conservation conflict interventions: The

Abstract = {Conflicts between the objectives of agricultural production and
   conservation are becoming increasingly complex. Of vital importance to
   the success of conflict interventions is a detailed understanding of how
   stakeholders react to management interventions as well as the influence
   of interacting social and political factors.
   Across Europe, goose populations have increased considerably, leading to
   widespread impacts on agriculture and significant conflicts between
   different stakeholder groups. We used a novel experimental game to
   understand farmer preferences regarding the design of goose conflict
   interventions in Scotland. We specifically examined how three
   alternative interventions (government financial support for scaring
   activities, subsidies and agglomeration payments that include bonus
   payments for adoption by neighbouring farms) affect farmer propensity to
   support goose conservation interests through reduced shooting and the
   provision of sacrificial crops. We also examined the links between
   within-game behaviour and real-life attributes and attitudes of farmers.
   We found that all three interventions were conducive to pro-conservation
   behaviour in the games. The effects of all three interventions were
   stronger among farmers who had higher trust towards other community
   members. Agglomeration payments led to increased provision of
   sacrificial crops among farmers with negative attitudes towards the
   current allocation of goose finances in Scotland. Farmers with more
   positive attitudes towards wildlife tourism were more likely to provide
   more sacrificial crops, and less likely to shoot in the games.
   Farmers' real-life traits had a statistically significant but marginal
   impact on the effectiveness of financial payments, such as the number of
   geese being shot on their own lands, remoteness and crop damage by
   geese.
   These game results provide evidence for the potential of innovative
   financial instruments in conflict management and their interactions with
   social factors such as community trust, equity attitude and real-life
   shooting levels. Our study highlights the importance of socio-political
   elements in fostering mutually beneficial outcomes in conservation
   conflicts in addition to addressing material losses to wildlife. We also
   show how games can help in addressing conservation conflicts in a wide
   range of settings.},

Abstract = {We compare the performance of four types of support schemes aimed at
   improving residential energy efficiency in France: the income tax
   credit, a grant scheme, the reduction of the value-added tax, and the
   White Certificates. We use the TREMI dataset which covers close to
   14,000 households that conducted conservation works. To address
   self-selection bias, we use a double-robust inverse probability
   weighting estimator. We assess the effect of the adoption of each scheme
   on the funding acquired, the private and total investment, and the
   reduction of the household energy expenses. For each scheme, we use the
   estimates to deduct its cost-effectiveness, the involved redistribution,
   and its ability to trigger additional investment in energy conservation
   works. We find funding from the schemes to reduce energy expenses most
   cost-effectively via the White Certificates. Redistribution is neutral
   for each of the four schemes: higher and lower income households equally
   benefit from them.},

Title = {Modeling genetic benefits and financial costs of integrating biobanking
   into the conservation breeding of managed marsupials},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Managed breeding programs are an important tool in marsupial
   conservation efforts but may be costly and have adverse genetic effects
   in unavoidably small captive colonies. Biobanking and assisted
   reproductive technologies (ARTs) could help overcome these challenges,
   but further demonstration of their potential is required to improve
   uptake. We used genetic and economic models to examine whether
   supplementing hypothetical captive populations of dibblers
   (Parantechinus apicalis) and numbats (Myrmecobius fasciatus) with
   biobanked founder sperm through ARTs could reduce inbreeding, lower
   required colony sizes, and reduce program costs. We also asked
   practitioners of the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) captive
   recovery program to complete a questionnaire to examine the resources
   and model species research pathways required to develop an optimized
   biobanking protocol in the black-footed ferret. We used data from this
   questionnaire to devise similar costed research pathways for Australian
   marsupials. With biobanking and assisted reproduction, inbreeding was
   reduced on average by between 80\% and 98\%, colony sizes were on
   average 99\% smaller, and program costs were 69- to 83-fold lower.
   Integrating biobanking made long-standing captive genetic retention
   targets possible in marsupials (90\% source population heterozygosity
   for a minimum of 100 years) within realistic cost frameworks. Lessons
   from the use of biobanking technology that contributed to the recovery
   of the black-footed ferret include the importance of adequate research
   funding (US\$4.2 million), extensive partnerships that provide access to
   facilities and equipment, colony animals, appropriate research model
   species, and professional and technical staff required to address
   knowledge gaps to deliver an optimized biobanking protocol. Applied
   research investment of A\$133 million across marsupial research pathways
   could deliver biobanking protocols for 15 of Australia's most at-risk
   marsupial species and 7 model species. The technical expertise and ex
   situ facilities exist to emulate the success of the black-footed ferret
   recovery program in threatened marsupials using these research pathways.
   All that is needed now for significant and cost-effective conservation
   gains is greater investment by policy makers in marsupial ARTs.},

Abstract = {One of the most effective measures for building energy conservation is
   the implementation of energy codes. The building energy codes
   introduction in Iran started two decades after the first oil crisis in
   the early 1970s by establishing the building energy conservation
   regulation called Issue 19. Nowadays, due to some financial and
   executive barriers, the implementation of Issue 19 is faced with some
   difficulties. The most critical obstacle is the low price of energy
   carriers, which lead to high subsidies of energy and the reluctance of
   the building owners to implement the regulation. The main goal of this
   paper is the introduction of an innovative financial and executive
   mechanism for implementation of Issue 19 in both new and existing
   buildings to achieve sustainability and resiliency. The cost-benefit
   analysis approach, along with SWOT technique and a comprehensive review
   of global experiences, was applied to introduce proper financial and
   executive mechanisms to determine the economic and social aspects of
   energy conservation programs for implementation of energy saving in
   buildings. The presented mechanism indicates the role of all different
   related parties, such as the government, banking system, energy-saving
   companies, building owners, and municipality, to achieve this goal. The
   results indicated that with a cost of \$10 million, the benefits of
   implementation of the introduced mechanism are over 5.78 billion
   dollars.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of conservation organizations is determined in part by
   how they adapt to changing conditions. Over the previous decade,
   economic conditions in the United States (US) showed marked variation
   including a period of rapid growth followed by a major recession. We
   examine how biodiversity conservation nonprofits in the US responded to
   these changes through their financial behaviors, focusing on a sample of
   90 biodiversity conservation nonprofits and the largest individual
   organization (The Nature Conservancy; TNC). For the 90 sampled
   organizations, an analysis of financial ratios derived from tax return
   data revealed little response to economic conditions. Similarly, more
   detailed examination of conservation expenditures and land acquisition
   practices of TNC revealed only one significant relationship with
   economic conditions: TNC accepted a greater proportion of conservation
   easements as donated in more difficult economic conditions. Our results
   suggest that the financial behaviors of US biodiversity conservation
   nonprofits are unresponsive to economic conditions.},

Abstract = {The topic of the paper is sponsorship for the
   requalification/conservation of historical-architectural heritage. In
   the literature, there are many models for evaluating the financial
   efficiency of sponsorship from the point of view of the sponsor (mostly
   in the sports field), but none of these jointly support both the sponsor
   and the sponsee in the selection of financially sustainable cultural
   sponsorships. Trying to reduce this gap, an innovative model is proposed
   for estimating the profitability of cultural sponsorship. The model
   consists of three phases. In the first, which consists of the financial
   analysis of the investment for the sponsee, the minimum amount that the
   sponsee can request from the sponsor is established. The second phase
   analyzes the financial performance of potential sponsors, estimating the
   optimal sponsorship budget that maximizes profits. In the final phase,
   where the results of the two analyses are compared, the sponsee
   eventually reformulates his offer and decides which company to sign the
   contract with. The model is tested through a case study: the sponsorship
   of the restoration of the Don Tullio Fountain in Salerno (Italy). It is
   assumed that two companies are interested in sponsorship. The results
   show that the investment is financially sustainable for both companies.},

Abstract = {To determine willingness to pay (WTP) for candidate entry fees,
   contingent valuation surveys were administered to 315 foreign visitors
   to the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal, during April and May of 2006.
   The results of logit regression showed that the bid amount, family size,
   visitors' satisfaction, the use of a guide, and group size were the most
   significant predictors of WTP. Results suggest that most visitors would
   be willing to pay an entry fee considerably higher than the current fee
   of 27 U.S. dollars (USD). The mean and median WTP were 69.2 and 74.3
   USD, respectively. the most common explanation for WTP by respondents
   was a desire to better protect the environment. The most common
   explanation for unwillingness to pay was that the bid was simply too
   expensive. Two models were developed based upon different predictions of
   visitor numbers (an optimistic case and pessimistic case) to calculate
   the expected revenue production and likely gross local economic impact
   of candidate entry fees. Based on this analysis, we recommend an
   increase in the entry fee to USD 50. In the optimistic scenario, this
   higher entry fee leaves a budget surplus. In the pessimistic scenario,
   it would reduce current budget deficits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Recent proposals to compensate developing countries for reducing
   emissions from deforestation ( RED) under forthcoming climate change
   mitigation regimes are receiving increasing attention. Here we
   demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon
   markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate
   billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also
   discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real
   climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while
   only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual
   scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and
   international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions.
   Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some
   countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance
   indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve
   substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human
   development. However, this will probably require targeted additional
   support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development
   needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from
   RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can
   contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development
   will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed
   incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the
   conservation and development communities.},

Title = {A dynamic approach to PES pricing and finance for interlinked ecosystem
   services: Watershed conservation and groundwater management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {24-33},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A theory of payment for ecosystem services (PES) pricing consistent with
   dynamic efficiency and sustainable income requires optimized shadow
   prices. Since ecosystem services are generally interdependent, this
   requires joint optimization across multiple resource stocks. We develop
   such a theory in the context of watershed conservation and groundwater
   extraction. The optimal program can be implemented with a decentralized
   system of ecosystem payments to private watershed landowners, financed
   by efficiency prices of groundwater set by a public utility. The theory
   is extended to cases where land is publicly owned, conservation
   instruments exhibit non-convexities on private land, or the size of a
   conservation project is exogenous. In these cases, conservation
   investment can be financed from benefit taxation of groundwater
   consumers. While volumetric conservation surcharges induce inefficient
   water use, a dynamic lump-sum tax finances investment without distorting
   incentives. Since the optimal level of conservation is generated as long
   as payments are correct at the margin, any surplus can be returned to
   consumers through appropriate block pricing. The present value gain in
   consumer surplus generated by the conservation-induced reduction in
   groundwater scarcity serves as a lower bound to the benefits of
   conservation without explicit measurement of other benefits such as
   recreation, biodiversity, and cultural values. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {``Splitting the bill{''} for conservation: Perceptions and uptake of
   financial incentives by landholders managing privately protected areas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Globally, privately protected area (PPA) programs are increasing in size
   and number. Participating in a PPA program can be fiscally challenging
   for landholders (e.g., enrollment costs; potential reduction in land
   value; opportunity costs; costs of ongoing management). Government and
   nongovernmental organizations often offer financial incentives to
   landholders, in addition to nonfinancial incentives, to encourage
   program enrollment and ongoing biodiversity management. In Australia,
   where conservation covenanting programs have been ongoing for several
   decades, a diversity of financial incentives is available to
   landholders. We surveyed 527 conservation covenantors from three states
   in southeast Australia to investigate the uptake, use, experience and
   preference for financial incentives. Less than half of covenantors
   received a financial incentive to enroll, but most applied for some form
   of incentive after enrollment, predominantly to help with management
   costs. Covenantors identified challenges in accessing incentives, such
   as being unaware of funding opportunities or experiencing confusing
   application processes. We found land rates rebates to be the preferred
   financial incentive among covenantors, in part due to the perception
   that covenantors should not have to pay full rates on covenanted land.
   Our results suggest that while covenantors do not participate in PPA
   programs for financial incentives, effectively and efficiently deploying
   financial incentives can reduce the financial burdens of PPA management,
   potentially increasing the effectiveness of conservation efforts.},

   sustainable financing approach in protected areas in Ethiopia},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An increasing number of protected areas (PAs) are being established in
   many countries to conserve and preserve the wildlife species and to
   maintain earth's ecological balance, but in emerging economies such as
   Ethiopia, PAs are currently confronted with inadequate conservation
   funding that makes it tough to protect the remaining biodiversity. PAs,
   therefore try to use other financial means such as ecotourism to
   subsidize their financial shortage and nourishes the nexus between
   conservation and development. Estimation of visitors' willingness to pay
   (WTP) would be useful to craft strategies to strengthen the
   self-financing capability of PAs and hence realizing environmental and
   livelihood goals. In this study, the visitors' WTP for the proposed
   conservation fund in the context of Bale Mountains National Park (BMNP)
   was estimated using a contingent valuation method. The finding indicated
   that 75\% of visitors were willing to pay a conservation fee. The mean
   WTP was estimated to be US\$7.40 for foreign visitors and US\$1.00 for
   domestic visitors. The finding suggests that the implementation of
   conservation fee in addition to the existing entry fee helps to improve
   the long-term sustainable financing of PAs.},

   watershed restoration and management, continuing environmental
   education, etc). The project's effectiveness since 2007 in achieving its
   conservation and education objectives was due to: (1) the facility and
   flexibility of the negotiations between borrowers (entire communities)
   and lender (conservation promoter), (2) the communities' involvement and
   enthusiastic acceptance of the project's ecosystem conservation insured
   its post-loan continuance at the grassroots level, (3) the rapid
   reloaning of repaid capital fund, thereby amplifying the donors'
   investment several times, and (4) the potential for its replication and
   scalability elsewhere in Central America.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in nature conservation is funding. In the
   pursuit of new financing sources critical to fight biodiversity and
   ecosystem loss, nature conservation organisations increasingly aim to
   create networks between states, markets and civil society. Using Manuel
   Castells' network theory and World Wide Fund for nature (WWF) as a case
   study, this article aims at understanding how large conservation NGOs
   utilise networking in their pursuit for funding. Apart from increasing
   income by attracting public funds from governments and aid agencies,
   around 2010 WWF's public sector finance strategy expanded to influencing
   and leveraging finance-both public and private-using public funds.
   During WWF's engagement with private sector financing, paradoxically its
   public sector financing grew at the average rate of 7.5\% per year. Our
   network analysis shows that WWF has continuously reworked and
   renegotiated its position in order to stay connected to the `space of
   flows'. WWF and other large conservation organisations have to be in the
   right networks, speak the right language, and connect to relevant
   social, informational and political flows to stay relevant and connected
   to substantial flows of funding.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The ocean is suffering the adverse effects of climate change and intense
   human activities. When addressing these ocean risks, ensuring sufficient
   finance to sustain the marine ecosystem and resources is an ever-present
   challenge. Blue finance is a crucial tool to ensure ocean
   sustainability, aligned with economic growth. This article provides a
   conceptual understanding of this emerging concept and explores the
   potential of using legal and institutional mechanisms to increase
   investment in ocean development programs. By reviewing existing blue
   financing practices and identifying opportunities and challenges, we
   find the significant challenge is to develop connections between all
   stakeholders to illustrate potential incentives for increasing private
   investment and public donations. As such, we propose a regulatory-driven
   financing mechanism incorporating the core concepts of blue finance in
   the context of marine governance, both at the international and domestic
   levels. Our proposed approach would boost blue financing by seeking a
   balance between economic growth and ocean sustainability.},

Title = {Evaluating combinations of on-and off-reserve conservation strategies
   for the Agulhas Plain, South Africa: a financial perspective},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {This study investigates the practical and financial implications of
   alternative strategies for meeting explicit conservation goals on the
   Agulhas Plain, South Africa. This is an area of exceptional biodiversity
   increasingly threatened by alien plant infestation, urbanisation, and
   agricultural expansion. In addition to traditional on-reserve
   protection, we identify two types of property-rights agreements
   (conservation easements and management agreements) and two types of
   financial incentives (land management assistance and tax relief) as
   appropriate for encouraging off-reserve conservation on targeted lands
   in the area. Specifically, we suggest actions to offset the costs facing
   landowners under new pieces of legislation, such as alien-clearing
   requirements and a property tax. After refining an existing GIS database
   of cadastral units targeted for conservation, we assigned on- or
   off-reserve conservation status to properties on the basis of a simple
   decision system, which took the irreplaceability of the area into
   account. Three implementation scenarios were designed: an entirely
   `on-reserve' approach, a mixed on- and off-reserve approach, and the
   mixed approach in conjunction with financial incentives. The
   conservation costs, to both the public and private sector (including
   expanded obligations from new legislation), were first modelled and then
   analysed in a Geographic Information System. We found that a traditional
   on-reserve approach would cost the state about R240M in acquisition
   costs, whereas both mixed approaches, using the decision rules developed
   in this study, would involve leaving 40\% of targeted areas in private
   hands, saving the state 80\% in acquisition costs. Of the subsequent
   conservation costs, which total R401M (present value @ 6\% discount
   rate; Scenario 1), most are alien clearing costs. Since landowners are
   now compelled to put up these costs, the state could make further
   savings (44 51 \%) under a mixed management scenario. Using Property
   Rate relief as an additional financial incentive is relatively efficient
   in that it may save targeted private landowners 32\% in Property Rates,
   at a cost of 5.5\% of expected tax revenue to the state. Given the
   prohibitive costs, realising conservation goals in the Agulhas Plain
   will probably depend upon the establishment of institutions, mechanisms,
   and incentives for private participation in conservation. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Shade-grown coffee is an important reservoir for tropical biodiversity,
   but habitat quality hinges on decisions made by farmers. Our research
   aims to investigate the link between coffee producers' decisions and
   outcomes for biodiversity, using epiphytes as our focal group. Using
   qualitative methods, we interviewed 33 producers in northern Nicaragua
   to understand how they connect trees and epiphytes on their farms to
   ecosystem services and how personal values, access to agronomic
   expertise, labor supply, and financial stability influence
   decision-making. We used interview responses to construct six producer
   typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees
   and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services.
   Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning
   services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic
   knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected
   epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics,
   producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in
   repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other
   forms of agriculture. The conservation significance and sustainability
   of this social-ecological system can be maintained and expanded through
   economic and capacity-building conservation interventions, especially
   when those can be connected to values already held by farmers.},

Abstract = {Despite decades of soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts in
   Tanzania, the adoption of the recommended SWC measures by farmers is
   minimal. In the past, SWC plans did not incorporate farmers' knowledge,
   and the economics of SWC was not given much attention at the planning
   stage. This research evaluated the applicability of two tools for
   participatory soil erosion mapping using farmers' indicators of soil
   erosion and financial analysis of SWC measures at the planning stage.
   The two tools were evaluated in Kwalei catchment in the West Usambara
   highlands, Tanzania. The participatory soil erosion-mapping tool uses
   farmers' indicators of soil erosion to identify, classify and map soil
   erosion at the catchment level. The financial analysis tool involves
   fanners in a stepwise analysis of the costs and benefits of SWC measures
   before the implementation. The erosion-mapping tool increased farmers'
   awareness on the severity of soil erosion problems, and they realised
   the need for SWC plans at both field and catchment scales. With the
   financial analysis tool farmers participated in the cost and benefits
   analysis and were able to select SWC options that were feasible under
   their socio-economic situation. The two tools were able to demonstrate
   that farmers' participation in SWC planning increases the acceptance of
   SWC measures because they solve problems that are perceived by
   themselves. The financial analysis tool demonstrated how farmers could
   make selection of SWC measures that are feasible under their biophysical
   and economic condition if they are informed about the costs and
   benefits. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Would community conservation initiatives benefit from external financial
   oversight? A framed field experiment in Namibia's communal conservancies},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {142},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is commonly asserted that the successful management of common
   property resources (CPR), and by extension, the provision of public
   goods such as biodiversity and carbon, requires the devolution of
   control to local communities. However, where trust in community
   institutions is low, the intrinsic motivation to co-operate may be
   diminished. In this study, we carried out surveys and framed field
   experiments on the introduction of payments for ecosystem services (PES)
   to Namibia's communal conservancies, established under the
   community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) programme. We used a
   threshold public good game where income from conservation efforts would
   require cooperation in terms of investing in conservation management and
   thereby also sacrificing opportunities to use designated wildlife areas.
   Our study found that households had low confidence in the conservancy
   management institutions and were more willing to co-operate when
   external financial oversight was provided. In fact, addressing the risk
   of financial mismanagement was more important than the payment level.
   Participants with a low level of confidence in the conservancy
   management contributed significantly less, but the gap narrowed when
   oversight was introduced. This suggests that initiatives to incentivise
   conservation of communally-owned land may require the close involvement
   of trustworthy external organisations to ensure their effectiveness.

Title = {How financial compensation changes forest owners' willingness to set
   aside productive forest areas for nature conservation in Denmark},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Agri-environmental schemes' ability to increase the provision of
   environmental goods has been questioned because such schemes may pay
   landowners for something they would have done anyway. Contributing to
   this discussion, the aim of this paper is to investigate how financial
   compensation changes forest owners' declared willingness to set aside
   productive forest areas for nature conservation. The study is based on a
   survey of forest owner attitudes and ownership objectives in Denmark.
   First, it was analyzed how forest owners' declared willingness to set
   aside productive forest area for nature conservation changed when they
   were offered financial compensation. The majority of forest owners
   (64\%) increased their willingness to set aside forest when offered
   financial compensation, whereas for others, compensation resulted in no
   change or, for a few respondents, even decreased the willingness. Hence,
   financial compensation may help to increase the provision of
   environmental goods but it is necessary to be aware of groups not
   motivated by financial incentives. Secondly, a binary logit model showed
   that the greatest likelihood of financial compensation increasing the
   motivation for setting aside forest is observed for owners who are
   young, female, live in the western part of Denmark and own farmland.
   Policy makers can use such information to target subsidy schemes at
   particular groups.},

Title = {Financial compensation and uncertainty: using mean-variance rule and
   stochastic dominance to derive conservation payments for secondary
   forests},

Abstract = {The expected opportunity costs of conserving a specific land use are
   usually considered adequate as financial compensation. However, a
   ``conservation premium'' is sometimes proposed as an added incentive,
   i.e., compensation greater than the expected opportunity costs. This
   paper discusses various methodological opportunities for deriving
   effective compensation under uncertainty. Based on cumulative
   distribution functions of possible opportunity costs (a Douglasfir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation was considered the
   alternative to conserving a Chilean secondary forest), generated through
   Monte Carlo simulations, we derived an inclusive range of possible
   compensations from 77 up to 375 US\$.ha(-1).year(-1). If we assumed that
   the two land-use alternatives were mutually exclusive and independent
   from other risky investments, a compensation of 375 US\$.ha-1.year-1 was
   necessary to convince every decision maker to maintain the secondary
   forest. However, only 77 US\$.ha-1.year-1 was enough for a risk-averse
   decision maker (given average opportunity costs of 113
   US\$.ha(-1).year(-1)). Yet, it turned out that the greatest possible
   opportunity costs would already be compensated for with 199
   US\$.ha(-1).year(-1), given an error probability of 0.05. Compensating
   for the last 5\% of possible opportunity costs would thus require an
   additional 176 US\$.ha(-1).year(-1). Our approach had two main
   limitations, namely we did not consider portfolio effects, which would
   allow diversifying away unsystematic risks, and we did not take into
   account the different systematic risks of the compared alternatives.
   These limitations may have led to an overestimation of effective
   compensation.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the implementation of a series of policies related to the energy
   conservation and environmental protection (ECEP) industry, green finance
   has become a crucial approach to provide credits for the ECEP industry.
   Using data on Chinese-listed ECEP firms from 2010 to 2019, this work
   quantitatively identifies the financing efficiency of these firms and
   its determinants. The main results show that banks are still dominant in
   the Chinese financial market for providing credits, and firms listed on
   the second board show higher financing efficiency. The financing
   efficiency of firms located in the central and western regions improves
   significantly, especially after 2016, reflecting the interaction effect
   of green finance policies and economic policies supporting
   underdeveloped regions. Both country-level factors (e.g., formal
   institutions and financial supervision) and firm-level factors (e.g.,
   firm size and debt ratio) have an impact on financing efficiency. These
   findings have important implications for policymakers who are carefully
   contemplating green finance policies to support ECEP firms through an
   effective financial market mechanism, which eventually helps to realize
   the transition of the energy sector.},

   enhancing the effectiveness of financial assurance. The research also
   explores recommendations, such as collaboration with international
   financial institutions and adopting standardized methodologies, to
   strengthen financial assurance systems and promote responsible practices

Title = {Building eco-surplus culture among urban residents as a novel strategy
   to improve finance for conservation in protected areas},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {The rapidly declining biosphere integrity, representing one of the core
   planetary boundaries, is alarming. In particular, the global numbers of
   mammals, birds, fishes, and plants declined by 68\% from 1970 to 2016.
   One of the most widely accepted measures to halt the rate of
   biodiversity loss is to maintain and expand protected areas that are
   effectively managed. However, doing so requires substantial finance
   derived from nature-based tourism, specifically visitors from urban
   areas. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) for conducting
   analysis on 535 Vietnamese urban residents, the current study examined
   how their biodiversity loss perceptions can affect their willingness to
   pay for the entrance fee and conservation in protected areas. We found
   that perceived environmental degradation, loss of economic growth, loss
   of nature-based recreation opportunities, and loss of knowledge as
   consequences of biodiversity loss indirectly affect the willingness to
   pay through the mediation of the attitude towards conservation. Notably,
   perceived knowledge loss also has a direct positive influence on the
   willingness to pay for the entrance fee and conservation. In contrast,
   perceived loss of health is negatively associated with the attitude
   towards conservation. Based on these findings, we suggest that building
   an eco-surplus culture among urban residents by stimulating their
   subjective cost-benefit judgments towards biodiversity loss can be a
   promising way to generate more finance from nature-based tourism for
   conservation in protected areas and ease the domestic government's and
   international organizations' funding allocation problems. Eco-surplus
   culture is a set of pro-environmental attitudes, values, beliefs, and
   behaviors shared by a group of people to reduce negative anthropogenic
   impacts on the environment and conserve and restore nature.},

Abstract = {In order to cope with the increasingly severe energy crisis and climate
   and environmental change, energy conservation and environmental
   protection industry has become an emerging field for the optimization of
   China's economic structure and the development of green circular
   economy. However, lack of funds restricts the growth of energy
   conservation and environmental protection industries. Aiming at the
   financing difficulty of energy conservation and environmental protection
   industry, this paper introduces supply chain finance theory and game
   theory to establish accounts receivable game model. In a two-level
   supply chain composed of the core manufacturer and the supplier with
   financial constraints, the optimal decision and profit of the supplier,
   manufacturer, and bank under the condition of three-party compliance are
   studied, by using the Stackelberg game model. At the same time, the
   supply chain financing game under complete information condition and
   incomplete information condition is analyzed theoretically. Finally,
   through the method of example analysis, it is proved that the supplier's
   initial capital, the manufacturer's order quantity, the bank interest
   rate, the supplier's financing pledge rate and so on have a significant
   impact on the supply chain financing income.},

Title = {A study on financial opportunity costs of growing local varieties of
   sorghum in Ethiopia: Implications for on-farm conservation policy},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {603-610},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in on-farm conservation is driven by its diverse
   attractive features its participatory nature and its flexible and
   dynamic features; its capacity to maintain not only crop diversity but
   the knowledge that evolves with it; and the chance it offers to link
   conservation with utilization and farmers' livelihoods. To implement
   this strategy on a sustainable basis, policy incentives are crucial.
   This paper argues that opportunity costs farmers face have a role to
   play to design sound policy incentives. Taking sorghum as an example,
   opportunity costs have been examined in this paper using data collected
   from 198 farmers in Eastern Ethiopia. The average opportunity costs
   suggest the size of the required policy incentives and they are the
   basis to estimate the national conservation costs for on-farm
   conservation. The regression analysis shows that opportunity costs
   increase with access to output markets and extension, output price,
   access to input supply, experience in growing improved varieties, and
   the relative importance of the crop. On the contrary, plot quality,
   input price, and oxen ownership are reducing the opportunity costs. The
   paper then concludes outlining the policy implications of the empirical
   findings to incentive design for on-farm conservation. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {Sustainable Financing Efficiency and Environmental Value in China's
   Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Industry under the
   Double Carbon Target},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Difficulty in financing and low financing efficiency is one of the
   bottlenecks that restrict the high-quality development of China's
   energy-saving and environmental protection industry and economy. The key
   to improving financing efficiency is to understand its influencing
   factors. This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the
   Malmquist index to measure the overall financing efficiency and the
   efficiency of different financing methods of 205 Chinese energy-saving
   and environmental protection industries from 2015 to 2020 from static
   and dynamic perspectives, respectively, as well as the Tobit model to
   estimate the impact of factors such as the digital transformation and
   green technological innovation of enterprises on financing efficiency.
   The study shows the following: (1) Static analysis shows that: the
   financing efficiency of the comprehensive technical efficiency of
   China's energy conservation and environmental protection industry is
   less than one, 5.8\% to 23.41\% of enterprises have very effective
   comprehensive technical financing efficiency, and fewer than 9\%
   enterprises have very effective scale efficiency levels. Enterprises may
   have more room for improving their financing efficiency in the future.
   The four types of financing are, namely, internal financing, equity
   financing, fiscal financing, and debt financing, in descending order of
   efficiency. (2) Dynamic analysis shows that the financing efficiencies
   of debt financing and fiscal financing are both on an upward trend,
   while internal and equity financing efficiencies are on a downward
   trend. Additionally, the technological progress change index and scale
   efficiency are two key factors affecting the financing efficiency of
   different financing methods. (3) In terms of financing methods, the
   comprehensive technical efficiency and scale efficiency of endogenous
   financing and equity financing are high, while the comprehensive
   technical efficiency and scale efficiency of debt financing and fiscal
   financing are low and flat. (4) Digital transformation, green technology
   innovation, the asset-liability ratio, profitability, and operational
   capability have a significant positive impact on the financing
   efficiency of energy-saving and environmental protection enterprises.
   This paper studies the financing efficiency of China's energy
   conservation and environmental protection industry under different
   financing methods and the mechanism through which key factors affect the
   financing efficiency of enterprises. It aims to provide a theoretical
   basis for managing financing methods scientifically and rationally and
   improving the financing efficiency of the energy conservation and
   environmental protection industry, as well as to provide practical
   reference for the implementation of digital transformation, green
   technology innovation and diversified financing in China and other
   developing economies.},

Title = {Understanding the financial incentive conundrum: A meta-analysis of the
   effectiveness of financial incentive interventions in promoting energy
   conservation behavior},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Household energy conservation plays an important role in the mitigation
   of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition towards a sustainable
   energy system. Financial incentives have been a popular intervention to
   facilitate lowering one's electricity consumption, and they have been
   used to target both overall conservation and conservation at specific
   times of high demand, also referred to as peak consumption. However,
   recent findings are ambiguous with regard to the effectiveness of
   financial incentives, and research has thus far not clearly disentangled
   the effects of incentives on overall and peak consumption. This study
   provides meta-analytic evidence on the effectiveness of financial
   incentive interventions and uses meta-regression techniques to
   systematically evaluate differences in incentive characteristics and the
   contexts in which they are implemented. Using data from 72 studies (with
   111 observations that include data from over 400,000 households), we
   compare the effects of financial information and actual incentives
   (e.g., pricing) on overall and peak electricity conservation. Financial
   incentives lead to a small decrease in overall consumption -1.83\%) and
   a larger decrease in peak consumption (-10.00\%), and effects of
   financial information are smaller compared to effects of actual
   incentives. Moreover, we find heterogeneous effects that can be further
   explained by differences in incentive types, characteristics, enhancing
   technologies, and study-level characteristics. We discuss theoretical as
   well as policy implications arising from these findings.},

Abstract = {In situ conservation is an effective strategy to protect biodiversity,
   and Brazil has one of the largest protected area (PA) systems in the
   world. However, the distribution of Brazilian PAs is uneven and the
   Caatinga drylands are poorly protected. As financial resources are
   essential for effectively managing PAs, we analyzed the Brazilian
   Government's budgetallocated to 20 federal PAs in the Caatinga between
   2008 and 2014, which ranged from 231,575 USD in 2008 to 13.5 Mi USD in
   2011. Neither expenses, nor the availability of funds, were homogeneous
   among PAs or throughout the years. Land acquisition in a single PA
   consumed similar to 75\% of the budget, and the two smallest PAs
   received proportionally the most money. Excluding land acquisition, the
   20 PAs received 0.50 USD/ha/year. Funds were allocated not to
   biodiversity conservation per se but mainly to securing offices, cars,
   and equipment. From 2012 onwards, the PA budget was reduced. Even
   including salaries, the budgetallocated for these PAs is similar to 13
   times lower than what the Ministry of the Environment declared necessary
   for the basic operation of protected areas in Brazil, 1.5 times lower
   than values spent worldwide, up to 5 times lower than spent in Latin
   American and African parks, and up to 72 times lower than spent in the
   European Union, exposing one cause of the precarious situation of the
   Caatinga PAs.
   Resumo A protecAo insitu e uma das formas mais efetivas para a
   conservacAo da biodiversidade e o Brasil tem um dos maiores sistemas de
   areas protegidas (APs) do mundo. A distribuicAo das APs brasileiras e
   heterogenea entre os biomas e a Caatinga esta entro os menos protegidos.
   A disponibilidade de recursos financeiros e imprescindivel para uma boa
   gestAo de APs. Este estudo analisou o orcamento disponibilizado pelo
   Ministerio do Meio Ambiente do Brasil para 20 APs federais da Caatinga,
   de 2008 a 2014. Os valores variaram de 231,575 USD, em 2008, ate 13.5 Mi
   USD, em 2011. Entretanto, a regularizacAo fundiaria de apenas uma AP
   consumiu similar to 75\% do orcamento total do periodo. NAo houve
   padronizacAo de gastos ou de disponibilidade de recursos entre APs e
   anos. As duas menores APs receberam proporcionalmente mais dinheiro que
   todas as demais. Excluindo-se gastos com regularizacAo fundiaria, as 20
   APs receberam em media 0.50 USD/ha/ano e os fundos nAo foram alocados
   para conservacAo da biodiversidade per se mas, ao contrario, para
   vigilancia patrimonial de escritorios, carros e equipamentos. A partir
   de 2012 uma tendencia de prover as APs com orcamentos crescentes foi
   interrompida e revertida, tornando o cenario financeiro instavel. Mesmo
   computando estimativas de salarios, o orcamento medio alocado para estas
   20 APs e similar to 13 vezes inferior aos valores apontados pelo proprio
   Ministerio do Meio Ambiente como necessarios ao funcionamento basico de
   uma unidade de conservacAo no Brasil, cerca de 1.5 vezes inferior ao
   gasto medio global, ate cinco vezes abaixo do gasto em parques da
   America Latina e africa, e ate 72 vezes inferior ao gasto na UniAo
   Europeia, expondo uma das causas da precaria situacAo das APs da

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Revenues derived from carbon have been seen as an important tool for
   supporting forest conservation over the past decade. At the same time,
   there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be
   expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this
   uncertainty, REDD+ projects and conservation initiatives that aim to
   take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from
   carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory
   multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of
   land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru,
   Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario
   building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for
   calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different
   future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues
   from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some
   landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less
   significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and
   the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the
   practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of
   future revenue from carbon finance. The future scenarios-based approach
   is useful to policy-makers and conservation program developers in
   distinguishing between landscapes where carbon finance can substantially

Title = {Does carbon financial market as an environmental regulation policy tool
   promote regional energy conservation and emission reduction? Empirical
   evidence from China},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Based on the panel data of prefecture-level and above cities in China,
   this paper uses a combination of Difference in-Difference and trajectory
   balancing methods to investigate the energy conservation and emission
   reduction effects of the carbon financial market as an environmental
   regulation policy tool. The results reveal that: (1) The energy
   consumption per unit of Gross Domestic Product experienced a significant
   decline after the implementation of carbon emission trading market
   policy in 2013. The carbon market policy has continuous positive effects
   on energy conservation and emission reduction. (2) There was no
   significant difference in energy consumption per unit of Gross Domestic
   Product in pilot cities and non-pilot cities before the implementation
   of the carbon emission trading policy. (3) Through the specific analysis
   of each pilot city via trajectory balancing method, all pilot areas
   produced energy conservation and emission reduction effects to different
   degrees. The energy conservation and emission reduction effects in
   Tianjin and Chongqing after the policy implementation were particularly
   obvious. Finally, we propose that China should adhere to the carbon
   trading policy of ``market decision and government regulation{''}, speed
   up the construction of carbon financial market, implement relevant
   policies according to regional differences, speed up the adjustment of
   regional industrial structure and improve the technological innovation
   ability of enterprises.},

Title = {Assessing the Impacts and Mechanisms of Green Bond Financing on the
   Enhancement of Green Management and Technological Innovation in
   Environmental Conservation Enterprises},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 14},
Abstract = {Environmental policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation
   represent crucial steps in striking a harmonious balance between the
   economy and the environment. Market-oriented green bonds have emerged as
   a notable instrument within environmental policy expression. In China,
   the adoption of green bonds reflects a shared commitment to dual carbon
   objectives and sustainable development, with both the government and the
   populace actively engaged. Drawing on theories of green management (GM)
   and technological innovation within environmental protection
   enterprises, this study formulates two hypotheses and analyzes a dataset
   comprising 1024 annual samples from 252 listed companies. This research
   explores the impact and underlying mechanisms of green bonds on GM and
   technological innovation within environmental protection enterprises.
   The findings reveal distinct patterns in the influence of green bonds
   issued before and after 2017. Specifically, for green bonds issued
   before 2017, the study identifies a significant, albeit negative,
   relationship at the 1\% significance level between bond issuance and
   technological innovation (-0.032). The environmental performance value
   associated with the enterprise's green strategy shows a notable negative
   correlation (-0.251), while enterprise value exhibits a positive
   relationship (0.155). Conversely, green bonds issued after 2017 exhibit
   a markedly different dynamic. The study detects a highly significant
   positive association between bond issuance and technological innovation
   at the 1\% significance level (1.322). Furthermore, the environmental
   performance value linked to the enterprise's green strategy demonstrates
   a substantial positive correlation (1.467), and enterprise value
   experiences a substantial increase (3.268). These findings underscore
   the pivotal role of green bond financing in significantly enhancing the
   technological innovation capabilities of environmental protection
   enterprises, particularly in the post-2017 period.},

Title = {Valuation of tropical forest services and mechanisms to finance their

Abstract = {The Tapanti National Park in Costa Rica comprises a precious but
   vulnerable tropical rain forest area. The monetary values of ecosystem
   services that are provided by this park are estimated in order to assess
   the mechanisms to finance the park's conservation and sustainable use.
   The main ecosystem services provided by the park are water supply (for
   drinking and electricity generation), maintenance of biodiversity and
   opportunities for recreation and tourism. Based on interviews with over
   300 stakeholders, the study identified the main beneficiaries of these
   ecosystem services. The monetary benefits of the three services combined
   were estimated at approx. US\$2.5 million/year, equivalent to an average
   of US\$43/year for the total park area (58.323 ha). Compared to other.
   similar areas, the recreation values are relatively low (approx. 0.6
   million US\$/year) while the water-supply service is very high: approx.
   1.7 million US\$/year for hydroelectricity and approx. 0.2 million
   US\$/year for drinking water. Both the low recreation and high water
   supply values can be correlated with the high rainfall of over 6500
   mm/year.
   To develop payment-mechanisms for the conservation and sustainable use
   of Tapanti National Park, the main stakeholders were asked about their
   willingness to pay for the maintenance of the services they benefited
   from. Different financing mechanisms have been explored, such as taxes,
   user fees, individual and corporate donations, friends' schemes, and
   voluntary contractual arrangements. In general, most of the stakeholders
   were willing to pay for the ecosystem services they received. These
   potential payments amounted to at least 400,000 US\$/year, which
   excludes the hydro-electricity beneficiary. Even without payments from
   the hydroelectricity company, this amount suffices to cover the current
   (245,000 US\$) and urgently needed additional budget (100,000 US\$) for
   the National Park management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Valuing visitor access to forested areas and exploring willingness to
   pay for forest conservation and restoration finance: The case of small
   island developing state of Mauritius},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {223},
Pages = {868-877},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Small island developing states share as common constraints their small
   size, geographical dispersion, greater vulnerability to rapid and
   drastic environmental change, and limited administrative and technical
   resources. Within these, they have to cater for urban and agricultural
   areas, as well as enough natural landscape for ecosystem services.
   Funding for conservation of forest ecosystems on these islands has
   received relatively less attention and national park systems are
   chronically underfunded. We used Mauritius as a case study to
   investigate the willingness to pay for conservation of state and
   privately owned forests. It is part of a biodiversity hotspot with
   highly threatened forest ecosystems, but has known some conservation
   successes. We designed and administered survey based contingent
   valuation approach to estimate the willingness to pay entry fees to
   visit forest areas across the island. Study results suggest
   international and domestic tourists have a mean willingness to pay of
   USD 7.73 and USD 3.74 respectively, for conservation. These values
   represent amounts visitors are willing to pay every time they visit a
   public or private forested site. Results show that mid-level supervisory
   roles positively influence willingness to pay values. Results also show
   that people aged 50 and above, not having any supervisory role, married
   with one child or less, tend to have lower willingness to pay for
   conservation.},
