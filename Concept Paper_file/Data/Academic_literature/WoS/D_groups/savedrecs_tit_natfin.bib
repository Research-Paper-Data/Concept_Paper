Abstract = {(1) Background: Green finance standards have proliferated with much need
   for harmonization to accelerate global green financial flows. However,
   little is known on the nature of green finance standards that
   accelerates differentiation, rather than harmonization. Therefore, we
   embark to answer the question what the nature of green finance standards
   is and specifically how green finance standards have evolved in major
   economic systems driven by different actors and leading to differences
   and commonalities over time and environmental focus area. (2) Methods:
   To analyze the question, we build a model based on institutional and
   standards theory and apply text analysis and statistical methods to
   analyze 84 green finance standards issued from 1998 to 2020. (3)
   Results: we find clear evidence that green finance standards evolve
   depending on economic governance types (e.g., market-based,
   government-based and in weak institutional environments), environmental
   focus areas (e.g., pollution, climate, biodiversity) and depend on
   actors in government, intermediaries and developing financial
   institutions. We also show that this development has been dynamic over
   the last few decades. We further test and confirm three models of green
   finance standards: output-based, input-based and process standards that
   have evolved. With the findings, we aim to provide a better foundation
   for both research and policy in future green finance standard research,
   development and harmonization.},

Title = {Green bonds in the world-ecology: capital, nature and power in the
   financialized expansion of the forestry industry in Brazil},
Journal = {RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID},

Abstract = {The 2008 financial crisis opened the doors of green capitalism as a
   financially sound approach to saving the planet from the worst effects
   of the climate emergency. The emphasis on the role of finance in
   promoting ``green growth{''} has permeated mainstream political,academic
   and business approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation,
   assuming multiple forms - from the carbon markets of the Kyoto Protocol
   and the Paris Agreement, to the Environmental, Social and Governance
   taxonomy for ``green{''} investments, to the proliferation of
   sustainable labels in several economic sectors. The present article
   offers a critical appraisal of one of the most prominent arguments that
   upholds the idea that it is possible and desirable to achieve
   sustainability and economic growth through finance: green bonds.
   Green bonds are debt instruments whose proceeds are earmarked to fund
   projects with supposedly environmental benefits. After some years in the
   background, they now occupy a central position in the green recovery
   narrative and political framework all over the world. Most of the
   academic literature tends to naturalize green bonds as an eminently
   technical solution to reconcile economic growth and environmental
   sustainability. Filling an epistemological gap, the present article
   leverages a world-ecology approach to embed the financial phenomenon of
   green bonds within the broader picture of the capitalist political
   economy and the expansion of its ecological frontier. In light of the
   ongoing experiences that the authors have been following in the
   Brazilian legal,financial and political context, the article unpacks and
   makes sense of green bonds as a tool in the hands of climate finance
   that reproduces global patterns of North-South uneven development and
   the shifting of ecological costs.
   To test the potential of the ``interpretative framework{''} offered by a
   world-ecology approach, we mobilize it in the concrete case of green
   bonds issuances directed to fund the forestry sector in Brazil. Aware
   that the current phenomenon only represents a blip in comparison to the
   largeer temporal (the longue duree) and spatial (the world system)
   scales usually deployed by world-ecology, we nonetheless discuss how the
   ideological, technical and power dynamics behind the issuance of green
   bonds unleash capital accumulation, produce a financialized and
   subordinated construction of nature, and entail an institutional
   arrangement.
   The article is organized around 3 main sections. After the introduction,
   section 1 describes green bonds as one of the most fashionable financial
   topics of the moment, and one that promotes a shift in discourses
   towards the need of actively building a ``green economy{''}. Although
   from a legal standpoint green bonds embody no significant difference
   from regular bonds, our focus is to describe the promises around them,
   the current (private) governance structure, and the trends in the
   issuance of these debt instruments both in the Global North and South,
   with a specific focus on the case of Brazil.
   In section 2, we look at the operations of green bonds emissions on the
   ground, i.e. taking as an example the context of green debt underpinning
   the Brazilian forestry sector. The analysis reveals how the emissions,
   made predominantly by large multinational companies actively present on
   the global market, feed off great efforts deployed by both the public
   and the private sector in constructing an image of the sector as a key
   player in the emergent ``bioeconomy{''} and in the strengthening of
   Brazil's goals in the Paris Agreement. However,we describe how green
   bond revenues that are officially committed to the implementation of
   ``sustainable management of forests{''} are associated with the
   expansion of the ecological frontier in the Brazilian territory,
   stretching the boundaries of the area dedicated to tree plantations and
   amplifying social and environmental tensions. The backstage of the
   emissions shows how capital accumulation through green bonds is
   associated with the coproduction of nature for the purpose of
   accumulation, generating concerns that are often diluted or transformed
   into procedural requirements. Debt generated by the subscription of
   green bonds, we argue, is not only financial, but also social and
   ecological.
   In section 3, we put forward that for private accumulation to be
   successful, green bonds in the forestry sector demand an institutional
   arrangement that combines state support and private governance of debt
   in its financial, social and ecological dimensions. Rather than being
   the result of an idealized and spontaneous market, a set of
   institutional transformations have to be considered in order to
   comprehend the feasibility of green bonds in the Brazilian forestry
   sector. We thus describe the historic connection between forestry and
   the state, the endless public incentives to put nature to work, the
   functional adaptations of the Brazilian environmental legislation and
   the regulation concerning the demarcation, access and use of land. In
   this context, we argue that green bonds add yet a new institutional
   layer to the process of creating and validating specific forms of
   nature, through a governance structure that dilutes the tensions between
   the promise of environmental benefits and its concrete negative social
   and environmental impacts.
   We conclude the article by reassembling these findings as part of the
   capitalist world ecology ``dialectical unity{''} of capital
   accumulation, co-production of nature and power. We suggest that the
   world-ecology approach allows us to grasp green bonds as a complex form
   that has so far been ignored in the relevant literature. As any other
   phenomenon of financialization, a green bond should not be understood in
   isolation from its material basis, since it is from that basis - and its
   social and environmental conditions and contradictions - that it
   appropriates value. As the example of the Brazilian forestry sector
   illuminates, the ``greenness{''} of the financial debt inscribed in
   green bonds may come into existence at the expense of the social and
   environmental debt that underlie the forestry sector productive model.
   Hence, although the explicit inclusion of ``environmental concerns{''}
   into financial considerations and project implementation has been
   praised as a step towards the recognition that finance has a material
   impact on the planet and that these externalities shall be accounted
   for, the article warns of the typical green arithmetic move put forward
   by green bonds. Green bonds inevitably co-produce nature and social
   relations, but in a very unequal way that emphasizes capital
   accumulation and that does not necessarily protect the environment (even
   when standards are introduced). Much to the contrary, green bonds may
   come into being at the expense of other ways of living ecologically, and
   by restoring injustices of the past and creating a regenerative future -
   in other words, by creating debt.},

Abstract = {Covid-19 changed the way many people viewed and interacted with the
   natural environment. In the UK, a series of national lockdowns limited
   the number of places that individuals could use to support their mental
   and physical health. Parks, gardens, canals and other ``green
   infrastructure{''} (GI) resources remained open and were repositioned as
   ``essential infrastructure{''} supporting well-being. However, the
   quality, functionality and location of GI in urban areas illustrated a
   disparity in distribution that meant that in many cases communities with
   higher ethnic diversity, lower income and greater health inequality
   suffered from insufficient access. This paper provides commentary on
   these issues, reflecting on how planners, urban designers and
   environmental organizations are positioning GI in decision-making to
   address inequality. Through a discussion of access and quality in an era
   of austerity funding, this paper proposes potential pathways to
   equitable environmental planning that address historical and
   contemporary disenfranchisement with the natural environment in urban
   areas.},

Title = {Building climate resilience through nature-based solutions in Europe: A
   review of enabling knowledge, finance and governance frameworks},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has firmly positioned itself as a global leader
   in promoting and implementing nature-based solutions (NBS). The recently
   released EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, Strategy on Adaptation to
   Climate Change, and Forest Strategy - all representing key pillars of
   the ambitious European Green Deal (EGD) - rely on NBS to both preserve
   and restore ecosystem integrity and increase climate resilience.
   Although research and policy in Europe have advanced the
   conceptualization and operationalization of NBS, a much wider adoption
   is needed to reach the ambitious goals of the EGD and fulfil its vision
   of transforming into a sustainable, climate-neutral, climate resilient,
   fair, and prosperous EU by 2050. In this paper, we review recent
   EU-supported research, policy, and practices to identify critical
   dimensions that still need to be addressed for greater uptake of NBS.
   While recognising the multiple societal challenges NBS can target, we
   build on the key messages from the `5th European Climate Change
   Adaptation conference ECCA 2021' and focus our analysis on NBS for
   climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. We screen a wide
   range of NBS cases across the EU and identify-three core challenges to
   implementation: the lack of a comprehensive evidence base on the
   effectiveness of NBS to address targeted challenges; the need for a
   greater involvement of the private sector in financing NBS; and
   opportunities for enhancing stakeholder engagement in the successful
   design and implementation of NBS. We take these challenges as the
   starting point for a broader reflection and critical discussion on the
   role of i) knowledge, i) finance, including investments in NBS and
   divestments from nature-negative projects, and iii) governance and
   policy frameworks to enable the uptake of NBS. We conclude by
   identifying options for the EU to foster the uptake of NBS in research,
   policy and practice.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into the intricacies of synthetic data, emphasizing
   its growing significance in the realm of finance and more notably,
   sustainable finance. Synthetic data, artificially generated to simulate
   real-world data, is being recognized for its potential to address risk

   insights into modeling environmental uncertainties, assessing volatile
   social and governance scenarios, enhancing data availability, and
   protecting data confidentiality. This critical review attempts first
   ever classification of synthetic data production methods, when applied
   to sustainable finance data gaps, elucidates the methodologies behind
   its creation, and examines its assurance and controls. Further, it
   identifies the unique data needs of green finance going forward and
   breaks down potential risks tied to synthetic data utilization,

Title = {Paying for green: A scoping review of alternative financing models for
   nature-based solutions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {337},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) are widely regarded as cost-effective
   responses to climate change and environ-mental degradation that also
   provide numerous co-benefits. However, despite significant policy
   attention, NBS plans often fail to materialize due to public budget
   shortfalls. Alongside traditional public finance, the inter-national
   debate increasingly urges the mobilization of private capital for NBS
   through alternative financing (AF) techniques. In this scoping review,
   we examine the literature on a) the AF models connected to NBS and b)
   the drivers and barriers associated with these AF models in terms of
   their financial technicity and their embedd-edness in the political,
   economic, social, technological, legal/institutional, and
   environmental/spatial ({''}PESTLE{''}) context. Although many models are
   discussed, the results indicate that none can be considered full
   substitutes for traditional public finance. Barriers and drivers
   converge around seven overarching tensions: new revenue and risk
   distribution vs. uncertainty, budgetary and legal pressure vs. political
   willingness and risk aversion, market demand vs. market failures,
   private sector engagement vs. social acceptance and risks, legal and
   institutional conduciveness vs. inertia, and upscaling potential vs.
   environmental risks and land use. Future research should focus on a) how
   to further integrate NBS monitoring, quantification, valuation, and
   monetization into AF models, b) systemic and empirical approaches to
   improve the understanding of the applicability and transferability of AF
   models, and c) an exploration of the potential qualities and social
   risks of AF models in NBS governance arrangements.},

Abstract = {Obtaining public and/or private finance for upscaling urban nature-based
   solutions (NBS) is a key barrier for reaching urban sustainability
   goals, including climate mitigation and adaptation. We carry out a
   systematic review of the academic literature to understand the key
   barriers and corresponding strategies for financing urban NBS. First, we
   report on specific financing challenges and strategies found for NBS
   uptake in four urban ecological domains: buildings, facades and roofs;
   urban green space (parks, trees); allotment gardens (including urban
   agriculture); and green-blue infrastructure. Across domains, we identify
   two overarching barriers of NBS finance: (1) coordination between
   private and public financiers and (2) integration of NBS benefits into
   valuation and accounting methods. We discuss strategies found in the
   literature that address these barriers; here, two things stand out. One,
   there is a large variety of valuation strategies that does not yet allow
   for an integrated accounting and valuation framework for NBS. Two,
   strategies aimed at coordinating public/private finance generally look
   for ways to encourage specific actors (real estate developers,
   residents) that benefit privately from an NBS to provide co-financing.
   We visualize our findings into a framework for enabling (public and/or
   private) finance for upscaling urban NBS.},

Abstract = {This editorial provides an analytical intervention to accompany the
   theme issue's empirical papers on ``Rethinking the Financialization of
   Nature.{''} The papers turn our attention towards three often neglected
   themes in prior research on finance and nature: (1) the frictional
   processes through which money leverages nature and resource-based
   ventures to produce more money ({''}Getting between M-C-M'{''}); (2) the
   role played by moralities, values, and affect in the financialization of
   nature and resistance levelled against it; and (3) the multiple roles of
   the state in mediating the circulation of finance in and through nature.
   We also engage with the politics of information and legitimation
   accompanying the financialization of nature to tease out levers for
   political critique. Finally, we map out a forward-looking agenda calling
   for research to engage more substantially with both the methodological
   questions accompanying the study of the financialization of nature, and
   the class dimensions of the process.},

Title = {Paying for nature-based solutions: A review of funding and financing
   mechanisms for ecosystem services and their impacts on social equity},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Funding and financing challenges remain a persistent barrier to
   implementing nature-based solutions that enhance ecosystem services,
   facilitate adaptation to climate change, and combat environmental
   stressors in cities. In the absence of adequate public financial
   resources, private funds are often expected to fill the gap. But
   market-driven, nature-based solutions can contribute to an inequitable
   distribution of urban ecosystem services by focusing on net benefits
   provided by nature. To help foster sustainable development and ensure
   that nature-based solutions reach diverse and historically marginalized
   populations and communities, this scoping review explores the ecosystem
   services provided by nature-based solutions and the payment mechanisms
   that produce and maintain them, focusing on literature on the United
   States. Findings suggest that the net benefits provided by nature-based
   solutions and the available payment mechanisms vary based on the
   solution utilized (e.g., urban trees, parks, community gardens).
   Further, the distribution of benefits from nature-based solutions is
   influenced by local historical, cultural, political, economic, and
   environmental contexts, the voices included in decision-making, and the
   payment mechanisms used. Inspired by social equity principles, we
   present a framework for ecosystem service provision that is sensitive to
   market-driven funding, financing, and partnerships. Practitioners can
   use this framework to assess whether payment schemes work in tandem with
   place (the local context) and process (governance and planning
   approaches) to ameliorate or exacerbate disparities in nature-based
   solutions and the benefits they provide to people.},

Title = {Financing coastal resilience by combining nature-based risk reduction
   with insurance},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing impacts of climate hazards combined with the loss of
   coastal habitats require urgent solutions to manage risk. Storm losses
   continue to grow and much of them are uninsured. These losses represent
   an increasing burden to individuals, businesses, and can jeopardize
   national development goals. Pre-hazard mitigation is cost effective, but
   both the public and private sector struggle to finance up-front
   investments in it. This article explores a resilience solution that
   combines risk transfer (e.g., insurance) with risk reduction (e.g.,
   hazard mitigation), which have often been treated as two separate
   mechanisms for disaster risk management. The combined mechanism could
   help align environmental and risk management goals and create
   opportunities for public and private investment in nature-based
   projects. We assessed this resilience insurance with hypothetical cases
   for coral reef restoration. Under conservative assumptions, 44\% of the
   initial reef restoration costs would be covered just by insurance
   premium reductions in the first 5 years, with benefits amounting > 6
   times the total costs over 25 years. We also test the sensitivity to key
   factors such as project cost, risk reduction potential, insurance
   structure, economic exposure and discount rates. The resilience
   insurance mechanism is applicable to many coastlines and can help
   finance nature-based adaptation.},

Abstract = {The paper examines connections between ontology and finance. The
   ontological debates concerning the role of finance are examined between
   two opposing schools of thought that can be labelled, very broadly,
   `instrumentalist' and `realist' (analytic-interpretivist). These two
   schools of thought have had momentous repercussions in understanding
   what is a good society. Each school defines Nature in particular ways
   which can be explored using ontology and philosophical insight. Our
   theoretical investigation aims to accommodate Nature in community
   financial deliberations. A positive role for government is advocated to
   finance environmental infrastructure initiatives. For example,
   precautionary strategies to address climate change must be funded. New
   roles for finance and government are proposed to align human
   relationships with Nature. Environmental precautionary principles must
   be developed in conjunction with finance theory to maintain decent
   standards of living for all. Reliance on impersonal market forces will
   not be enough to save the planet given the power of some over the many
   in the neoliberal arena.},

Title = {Investing in the wealth of nature through biodiversity and ecosystem
   service finance solutions},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {66},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The last fifteen years have been transformative in the field of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services finance. The Kunming-Montreal Global
   Biodiversity Framework (GBF) articulated a pathway to achieve the global
   vision of ``living in harmony with nature{''} by 2050, with four goals
   and 23 targets to be met by 2030. Published reports indicate
   biodiversity finance needs are on the order of seven times current
   investments. This paper reviews recent public and private sector efforts
   to address this biodiversity finance gap and suggests priorities to
   increase progress toward its closure. In this review of biodiversity
   finance, we first provide a brief historical overview of the
   biodiversity finance gap, next describe current methodologies designed
   to identify, quantify, and bridge the gap in the public and private
   sectors, two sections reviewing current public and private sector
   efforts to close the gap follow, and a discussion of future directions
   and trends concludes. From asset management to biodiversity credits to
   crowdfunding, and from debt for nature swaps to environmental fiscal
   transfer and green bonds, we highlight efforts in the global south to
   address their biodiversity finance needs and meet their commitments to
   the Convention on Biological Diversity. Research on subsidies harmful to
   nature, more effectively connecting biodiversity outcomes to financial
   investments, identifying finance mechanisms that generate climate and
   biodiversity co-benefits, and further innovation in private sector
   solutions like biodiversity credits and offsets are future priorities
   and perhaps a research agenda in this sphere. We hope this review
   generates discussion and a research agenda within the biodiversity
   finance community to help us fulfil the ambitious goals of the GBF by
   2030.},

Title = {Reducing the finance gap for nature-based solutions with time
   contributions},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBS) to climate change and other environmental
   challenges face a well-documented shortfall in financing and resource
   allocation. Economic evaluations of NBS that apply stated preference
   methods increasingly use time contributions instead of the traditionally
   used monetary contributions, especially in developing countries. These
   studies have focused on measuring the benefits of NBS and have not
   investigated the potential of freely provided community time
   contributions to reduce the financial needs of NBS. In this paper we
   investigate this potential through a systematic literature review and an
   analysis of four datasets from case studies in Ghana and Vietnam that
   apply similar questionnaires and discrete choice experiments with time
   contributions. We study a range of (de)motivating factors to
   contributing time to NBS and provide examples on the extent to which
   time contributions could reduce financial needs of NBS in developing
   countries. The results indicate that time contributions from households
   for the implementation and maintenance of NBS are motivated by social
   capital and coping appraisal. Time contribution schemes are therefore
   more likely to succeed in communities where social capital and coping
   appraisal are high and could be increased or maintained over time
   through the preservation and fostering of both these factors. The
   analysis also reveals that implementing time contributions would in
   general not lead to the exclusion of specific socio-demographic groups
   in society, such as lower income households. Finally, using two specific
   projects in Vietnam as examples, we calculate that time contributions
   can reduce 29\% and 44\% of the financial needs of NBS by covering the
   projects' labour requirements. These results are of high importance to
   those working on NBS financing, awareness and behavior change campaigns,
   and practitioners that apply stated preference methods in developing
   countries.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-234},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Efforts to address environmental problems have led to a rapid
   proliferation of mechanisms for creating financial value for nature.
   This paper argues that the creation of financial value for nature
   requires work to disentangle and frame the relation between people and
   nature so as to render this relation calculable, and that this work acts
   to alienate people from nature. To pursue and progress this argument,
   the paper analyses the work of the United Nations Framework Convention
   on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to establish a mechanism to create financial
   value for tropical forests based on their capacity to store carbon. The
   analysis finds that the UNFCCC's work of disentanglement and framing, so
   as to render calculable the relation between people and forests, has
   created conditions that threaten to materially degrade the ecological
   value of tropical forest biodiversity and the cultural/spiritual value
   of forests to indigenous peoples. The findings support this paper's
   argument that the alienation of people from nature is not simply a
   consequence of financial valuation, but rather is a necessary
   prerequisite for creating financial value for nature.},

   Closing the financing gap between what is currently spent and what is

   provide, is estimated to exceed hundreds of billions per year. Yet there
   are no studies in the top tier journals in finance that have framed the

   as a new frontier for investment, and 2. the rewriting of conservation

   impetus with relevance for environmental conservation. I then note ways
   in which a spectacular investment frontier in conservation is being
   opened. I highlight the draw of assertions of lucrative gains, combined
   with notions of geographical substitutability, in creating tradable
   indicators of environmental health and harm. I disaggregate
   financialisation strategies into four categoriesnature finance, nature
   work, nature banking and nature derivativesand assess their
   implications. The concluding section embraces Marx and Foucault as
   complementary thinkers in understanding the transforming
   intensifications of late capitalism in environmental conservation, and
   diagnosing their associated effects and costs.},

Title = {Financing climate adaptation in Flemish cities: Unpacking financial
   strategies and policy dynamics for nature-based solutions},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {248},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As climate change continues to impact cities, nature-based solutions
   (NBS) are being advanced as important adaptation strategies for
   mitigating these negative effects. As is the case throughout Europe,
   Flemish cities have enacted adaptation policies and plans outlining the
   importance of NBS. Nevertheless, the implementation of NBS has been
   slow. Local governments identify financing as an important barrier.
   Although private financing is often proposed as a solution, few studies
   have applied a public-financing perspective to generate insight into and
   remedies for such issues. In this article, we examine how four Flemish
   cities are financing NBS implemented in public spaces as climate
   adaptation strategies. Based on a multiple case study approach, our
   results uncover that different financing strategies are employed during
   the design, implementation and maintenance phase of developing NBS
   projects. Additionally, we learn that the interplay between policy and
   financing becomes an important catalyst for investments in public NBS.
   We identified three approaches administrations use to secure (public)
   resources. During the design phase, support is developed within the
   administration and politically through (1) fostering internal
   collaboration by developing integrated spatial NBS designs. In the
   implementation phase resources are attracted by (2) putting the
   developed spatial designs to work and seizing available funding
   opportunities. During the maintenance phase (3) strategic partnerships
   are established with NBS beneficiaries to alleviate costs for
   municipalities. We conclude that, in the absence of more long-term forms
   of public financing, these approaches offer smaller cities tools to
   overcome the financial barrier.},

Title = {Key Innovations in Financing Nature-Based Solutions for Coastal
   Adaptation},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The implementation of nature-based solutions (NBSs) for coastal
   adaptation to climate change is limited by a well-documented lack of
   finance. Scholars agree that financial innovation represents a solution
   to this problem, particularly due to its potential for mobilising
   private investments. It remains unclear however how exactly innovative
   solutions address the specific barriers found in NBS implementation and,
   given the distinctive local characteristics of NBSs, to what extent
   successful innovations can be replicated in other locations. This study
   addresses this issue by reviewing the literature and case studies of
   innovative financial solutions currently implemented in NBS projects,
   highlighting which financial barriers these arrangements address and
   which contextual conditions affect their applicability. We find that
   there is no ``low-hanging fruit{''} in upscaling finance in NBSs through
   financial innovation. Innovative solutions are nevertheless expected to
   become more accessible with the increase in NBS project sizes, the
   increased availability of data on NBS performance, and the establishment
   of supportive policy frameworks. The flow of finance into NBS projects
   can be further enhanced through the external support of both public
   (de-risking and regulation) and private actors (financial expertise).},

Title = {Nature as Accumulation Strategy? Finance, Nature, and Value in Carbon
   Markets},
Journal = {ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {108},
Number = {3},
Pages = {605-619},
Abstract = {This article examines the contradictions and possibilities of ``nature
   as accumulation strategy{''} in light of the breakdown of accumulation
   in emissions trading and carbon offsetting schemes established by the
   European Union and United Nations. The first section revisits accounts
   of carbon markets as a state-driven accumulation strategy by drawing on
   work by geographers and other political economists who understand
   capitalist value relations as being actively constituted by nature and
   finance. The second section provides an overview of how carbon is traded
   and presents data to document the growth and decline of financial
   activity in the main global carbon markets, focusing on the impact of
   weak carbon prices. The third section analyzes accumulation dynamics in
   carbon markets in terms of the extent to which carbon has or could
   become an emergent form of capital. It argues that states have failed to
   support the carbon market accumulation strategy due to tensions between
   socioecological relations of appropriation and capitalization that are
   internal to the carbon commodity. It also argues, however, that the
   commodification of carbon, as ``metanature,{''} contains the potential
   to sustain accumulation by comparing and enforcing the profitability of
   different forms of pollution. The conclusion discusses implications for
   critical political-economic research on finance, nature, and value in
   contemporary capitalism and the efficacy of market-based climate policy.},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in nature conservation is funding. In the
   pursuit of new financing sources critical to fight biodiversity and
   ecosystem loss, nature conservation organisations increasingly aim to
   create networks between states, markets and civil society. Using Manuel
   Castells' network theory and World Wide Fund for nature (WWF) as a case
   study, this article aims at understanding how large conservation NGOs
   utilise networking in their pursuit for funding. Apart from increasing
   income by attracting public funds from governments and aid agencies,
   around 2010 WWF's public sector finance strategy expanded to influencing
   and leveraging finance-both public and private-using public funds.
   During WWF's engagement with private sector financing, paradoxically its
   public sector financing grew at the average rate of 7.5\% per year. Our
   network analysis shows that WWF has continuously reworked and
   renegotiated its position in order to stay connected to the `space of
   flows'. WWF and other large conservation organisations have to be in the
   right networks, speak the right language, and connect to relevant
   social, informational and political flows to stay relevant and connected
   to substantial flows of funding.},

Volume = {56},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {The use of financial instruments for climate change mitigation puts
   communities and nature at risk. Success is measured by capital
   accumulation rather than the ability to protect or enhance human and
   nonhuman nature. From cap and trade programmes that allow corporations
   to buy and sell `units' of pollution on financialized markets, to forest
   offset credits, the financialization of nature presupposes the
   separation and quantification of the Earth's cycles and functions with
   carbon, water, and biodiversity. Financialization causes these cycles to
   be treated as units to be sold in financial and speculation markets.
   This article reviews the theoretical frameworks of financialization of
   nature and proliferating climate change policies. I explore the flaws of
   the new carbon pricing and carbon tax platform in Colombia and its
   impacts on Afro-Colombian communities in the coal mining region of
   Cesar, in northeast Caribbean and related Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) projects on the Pacific

Title = {Insuring Climate Change: New Risks and the Financialization of Nature},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {484-501},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Insurance is a central institution in modern societies. Economic and
   technological developments generate `new risks', which are often covered
   by new forms of insurance. Because of its underlying uncertainty - the
   difficulty both of predicting its effects and evaluating its costs -
   climate change represents a major challenge for the insurance industry.
   It also represents a challenge for states, who have historically played
   the role of insurers `of last resort' in the event of catastrophes. This
   article examines the ongoing financialization of climate risk insurance,
   which is part of a larger trend of financialization of nature.
   Financialization, through measures such as `catastrophe bonds', is the
   neoliberal solution to the rising costs of natural disasters which the
   insurance industry has experienced since the 1990s. The article analyses
   the effects of financialization on the insurance industry, on the
   state's role as insurer `of last resort', and on associated forms of
   knowledge production (big data), critiquing the process of
   financialization on both economic and political grounds.},

Title = {Reviewing the nature and pitfalls of multilateral adaptation finance for
   small island developing states},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Abstract = {Small island developing states (SIDS) are recognized as being among the
   most vulnerable countries to climate change-many are highly exposed and
   sensitive to, inter alia, sea-level rise and increased intensity storms,
   yet often lack the human and financial resources needed for successful
   and/or effective adaptation. The international community has responded
   to SIDS' precarious situation, in part, by establishing a suite of
   multilateral funding mechanisms to help finance costly adaptation
   projects and programs. However, to date, there has been a mismatch
   between the level of international climate finance mobilized and the
   scale of adaptation that is needed in SIDS. This paper reviews the
   relevant academic and policy literatures to provide a system-wide
   diagnosis of the institutional and conceptual problems plaguing
   adaptation-specific multilateral climate funds, which are often
   addressed in isolation. We show that, following the establishment of the
   Global Environment Facility, many multilateral climate funds have been
   rife with administrative issues, creating barriers to access for
   particularly vulnerable countries. The funding that SIDS do receive is
   often insufficient to meet the costs of adaptation, and funding
   allocations are demonstrably skewed amongst SIDS and amongst types of
   adaptation projects and programs funded. In concluding, we propose
   reorienting multilateral adaptation finance towards resilience as a
   means of improving the governance of international adaptation finance
   and increasing access for SIDS and other particularly vulnerable
   countries.},

Title = {How financial compensation changes forest owners' willingness to set
   aside productive forest areas for nature conservation in Denmark},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {564-573},
Abstract = {Agri-environmental schemes' ability to increase the provision of
   environmental goods has been questioned because such schemes may pay
   landowners for something they would have done anyway. Contributing to
   this discussion, the aim of this paper is to investigate how financial
   compensation changes forest owners' declared willingness to set aside
   productive forest areas for nature conservation. The study is based on a
   survey of forest owner attitudes and ownership objectives in Denmark.
   First, it was analyzed how forest owners' declared willingness to set
   aside productive forest area for nature conservation changed when they
   were offered financial compensation. The majority of forest owners
   (64\%) increased their willingness to set aside forest when offered
   financial compensation, whereas for others, compensation resulted in no
   change or, for a few respondents, even decreased the willingness. Hence,
   financial compensation may help to increase the provision of
   environmental goods but it is necessary to be aware of groups not
   motivated by financial incentives. Secondly, a binary logit model showed
   that the greatest likelihood of financial compensation increasing the
   motivation for setting aside forest is observed for owners who are
   young, female, live in the western part of Denmark and own farmland.
   Policy makers can use such information to target subsidy schemes at
   particular groups.},

   dominant investors in the resource-based economies of Africa. Some of
   the investments that these funds make have been speculative and based on
   perceived high-value futures in biodiversity, bio-fuels and land, carbon
   capture or strategic minerals. However, private equity funds are also
   heavily invested in mining, energy and infrastructure, which also
   generate wealth from the non-human world; old markets alongside the new
   markets for discovered nature-based commodities. This article reviews
   how private equity funds, and their partners in development finance
   institutions, frame and value the consequential impact of their
   industries on people and things. It then explores how this valuation,
   and other related calculative technologies of concern for the
   environment such as risk assessment and offsetting are incorporated into
   firms investment decision making. This enquiry finds that: 1) financiers
   currently employ thin, partial and pseudo-mathematical methods of
   assessing environmental impact and worth; and 2) that environmental and
   developmental impact science is a performative technology, with only
   marginal relation to the material world it seeks to measure and protect.
   Using calculative technologies in which financial considerations are
   privileged, financiers have wrought a dissociated, incomplete and
   partial valorization of the non-human world. Nonetheless, 3) these
   calculative devices assist in legitimizing private equity funds as
   institutional leaders in pre-existing power structures which exploit
   natural resources in Africa for the benefit of money-holders. These
   propositions roughly correspond to the technical, empirical and
   theoretical dimensions of a socio-technical arrangement applying to
   nature-based accumulation, which, overall, performs a political process
   of financialization.},

Journal = {CLIMATE LAW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The article analyses the impact of the origins of emission units in
   transnational climate policy on market participants in the EU ets and
   the extension of financial-market regulation to the European carbon
   market. To assess the consequences of the public-private nature of
   emission units, a broad view of ownership is taken. Ownership is
   understood as the legal position of the holder of emission units, being
   an aggregate of elements of private law but also climate law and
   financial-market regulation. As a consequence, a picture emerges of a
   legal position variable in the personal, temporal, and spatial
   dimensions, following policy-design choices and the evolution of
   regulation of carbon markets. The ownership of emission units reflects
   the ongoing balancing of the different public-policy goals of the EU ets
   and differs from economic theories laying the foundations of emission
   trading. Due to the necessity for a proactive management of the scheme,
   regulatory intervention and risk have become inherent features of the
   ownership of the units, and the impact of changes will vary across
   different market participants.},

Abstract = {In light of the myriad new measures implementing the Commission's
   Sustainable Finance Action Plan, this article examines whether
   sustainable finance can be considered an autonomous objective of
   financial regulation, and how this objective should be positioned
   relative to the traditional objectives of financial regulation:
   stability, market integrity, and consumer protection. Having assessed
   the measures that weave sustainable finance into the financial rulebook,
   the article finds that sustainable finance is not an autonomous
   objective of financial regulation yet, but that it has the potential to
   become one in the future, and that in case of a conflict between
   sustainable finance and the traditional objectives of financial
   regulation, the former should give way to the latter. The article
   concludes by identifying a novel trend. Pending stricter environmental,
   social and governance regulation, financial regulation has been
   instrumentalized to advance sustainable development by nudging companies
   to apply higher environmental, social and governance standards than
   legally required.},

Abstract = {The study objectives were to identify external sources of financing the
   nature and forest education and to analyze the level of their use in
   regional directorates of the State Forests (RDSF) in the years
   2006-2016. In addition, we studied the relationship between the amount
   of external and internal financing. As a data source, we used reports on
   educational activities of the State Forests for the investigated period.
   The work determines the relationship between individual categories of
   external funds and the amount of total funding and the amount of
   external financing for forest and nature education in individual RDSFs.
   In order to examine the relationship between the amount of external and
   internal financing, correlation analysis of changes was carried out. The
   conducted research confirmed the diversity in the use of the individual
   external sources in the financing of forest and nature education in the
   State Forests. The RDSFs use mainly money from the voivodeship funds for
   environmental protection and water management. They also conduct
   extensive cooperation with various entities, which participate in
   expenditures, hence a significant share of these funds in the financing
   of forest and nature education. We found a weak correlation between the
   amount of funding raised from voivodeship funds for environmental
   protection and water management and own sources of education financing
   (r=0.2162) and between other external sources and own sources of funding
   (r=0.2717). On the other hand, a high correlation occurred between funds
   from voivodeship funds for environmental protection and water management
   and other external sources of financing and external financing (r=0.6544
   and 0.617, respectively). RDSFs should intensify their activities aimed
   at changing the structure of financing sources, in favor of increasing
   the share of external funds. The priority in this respect should be to
   clarify the rules of financing forest and nature education from the
   state budget and of using the funding opportunities from this source.},

Abstract = {The current biodiversity loss is dramatic. Over the past 50 years, more
   than 68\% of the mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish on Earth
   have disappeared, putting the planet's survival and its
   inhabitants-including human beings-at risk. Financialization, or the
   transformation of nature into financial assets, is increasingly proposed
   as a solution to the biodiversity crisis. Proponents of financialization
   believe that assigning a monetary value to nature will incentivize human
   beings to protect habitats and their species. This article offers a
   four-mechanism model of nature's financialization, explaining why it is
   virtually impossible to financialize nature. We collected data through a
   unique two-stage data collection process, including a single case study
   and additional interviews with conservationists and conservation finance
   specialists. We analyzed the development of a calculative device, the
   ``Index,{''} designed to assess the impact of conservation efforts on
   the survival of endangered species. Conservationists hoped to use the
   Index to calculate the financial return of a conservation impact bond, a
   financial instrument designed to finance conservation projects. However,
   they did not achieve their goal. We discuss the implications for the
   financialization and conservation literature and the role of accounting
   therein. We notably question previous accounts of financialization,
   including the need for financial numbers or financial actors. We
   ultimately show that a financialization project can transform practices
   toward financialization, even if the financialization process is not
   complete.},

Abstract = {The issue of disclosure of non-financial information has become subject
   of increased interested among researcher and academics. Although the
   disclosure of non-financial information by organisations is increasing,
   it is questionable whether the current level of reporting can satisfy
   the increasing demand for accountability and transparency shown by
   stakeholders. In order to provide stakeholders with all information they
   desire, organisations need to provide information that makes it possible
   to estimate organisations environmental and social performance. As such
   quantitative information is being perceived as more reliable and
   objective. Therefore it has been decided to undertaken the attempt to
   diagnose the nature of non-financial information disclosed by Polish
   organisations understood as the form in which non-financial information
   is being presented, as well as whether organisations prepare
   non-financial reports or include non-financial reports into reporting
   and if so. if they use standards and guidelines while preparing reports.
   For this purpose CATI research with .102 companies listed on the Warsaw
   Stock Exchange between September and November 2016 has been conducted.
   The results have been analysed using descriptive statistics. The
   research shows that organisations report on non-financial information
   rather unwillingly. Organisations more willing to disclose non-financial
   information are the ones mapping stakeholders they present the data
   using indicators and also include non-financial information in reports.
   They prepare reports using the GRI 4 guideline. Organisations not
   mapping stakeholder do not disclose non-financial information in
   general. The research is applicable not only for academics but also for
   practitioner as it presents the diversity of possible non-financial
   disclosure.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {92B},

Pages = {159-173},
Abstract = {This article explores two inter-related themes. One addresses
   fundamental questions of human nature, arguing that conventional
   theories of behaviour lack a credible appreciation of the interaction
   between cognition and context (or what is often termed as the
   `environment'). The second considers decision-making under risk and
   uncertainty, focusing upon customary behaviour and the significance or
   otherwise of conscious deliberation. My argument is intended to be both
   critical and constructive, exploring the claims of the emerging school
   of behaviouralism associated with Kahneman and Tversky now sweeping the
   social sciences. Most importantly, it is argued that economic geography
   should take more seriously the nature and scope of behaviour recognizing
   its attributes including related social and cultural aspirations. These
   ideas are illustrated by a set of recent studies dealing with financial
   decision-making and individuals' attitudes towards risk in personal and
   occupational pension plans. The importance of this project lies in the
   urgent need to understand the diversity of behaviour of men and women
   in, and through, the communities in which they live without being
   reduced to yet another version of environmental determinism. In the
   final section, implications are drawn for understanding the global
   financial crisis.},

   Implementing Innovative Governance and Financing Concepts},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nature-based solutions (NBSs) are considered sustainable,
   cost-efficient, and resource-efficient land-use management approaches.
   When analysing NBS business models, two major challenges are commonly
   identified as slowing down broader NBS implementation: governance and
   financing barriers. This explorative study aims first to test the
   applicability of a NBS specific business model template and, second, to
   provide a clustered NBS business model pilot case study collection,
   which enables transferable solutions for overcoming the typical
   implementation challenges to be derived. Methodically, this is achieved
   by using the Nature-based Sustainability Business Model Canvas (NB S BMC
   for guided interviews. Twenty-three NBS case studies from proGIreg's
   four Front Runner Cities, namely Dortmund, Ningbo, Turin, and Zagreb,
   are examined. Pestoff's welfare triangle enables the NBS business models
   to be clustered. The main business model clusters are public provision,
   sales, and diversified. NBSs' governance models are very adaptable to
   individual NBS cases, of the independent type, and can include a huge
   diversity of involved stakeholders regarding their functions in the NBS
   implementation. Our findings highlight adaptable governance models
   across diverse stakeholder functions and confirm the NB S BMC as a
   robust framework for understanding NBS business models. These insights
   extend to land-use practices beyond NBSs, offering a template for
   innovative urban planning strategies.},

Abstract = {Conservation finance is a nascent field that claims to deliver maximum
   conservation impacts, while, at the same time, generating returns for
   investors (Credit Suisse/WWF). While geographers have questioned the
   ability of conservation finance to play a significant role in
   international biodiversity conservation, an emerging cohort of boutique
   private equity firms are actively generating returns on North American
   conservation projects. This raises the question: how are these firms
   generating profits, and in turn, returns for their shareholders? Drawing
   from a Marxian understanding of finance as redistributive, I argue that
   these firms are generating profits through a process similar to a
   corporate hostile takeover. Using the examples of ranchland and
   timberland investment in the United States, I show that (1) the
   materialities and historical geographies of these landscapes play a
   crucial role their monetization, and (2) shareholder returns are
   generated through a combination of traditional real estate sales and
   revaluations, public monies, and commodity production.},

Title = {Finance for nature: A global estimate of public biodiversity investments},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
   will meet at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP 15) to carve out a
   post-2020 framework for global biodiversity conservation. Finance will
   be among the priority concerns. No global estimates of public
   biodiversity investments are in the peer reviewed literature. The
   methodology developed by the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)
   provides a means for countries to account systematically for their
   biodiversity expenditures. Importantly, budget lines that intentionally,
   but secondarily, affect biodiversity outcomes are assigned a percentage
   at which they can be attributed to biodiversity. A sample of thirty
   countries facilitated the construction of a panel to predict public
   biodiversity investments at a global level. Here we show that global
   public biodiversity investments have increased steadily to an average of
   US\$121 billion invested annually from 2008-2017, or 0.19-0.25\% of
   global GDP. Our data not only indicate an increasing trend in total
   biodiversity investment, but also an increase in the percentage of total
   public domestic investment dedicated to biodiversity.},

Title = {Physical and financial barriers to implementing a nature reserve network

Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {165-172},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {To understand the potential financial cost of acquiring lands within a
   proposed reserve network for the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, we used an
   assessors GIS database to estimate the acquisition cost in one county
   within the network to be US\$ 2.5 billion. When only larger parcels were
   selected for the reserve network, the cost of the network decreased
   exponentially as the size-threshold for parcel selection increased,
   while the total area of the network decreased only linearly. Although
   acquiring only larger parcels may make sense financially, it does not
   result in adequate habitat representation because the spatial
   distribution of parcels is such that the lower elevation oak woodland
   and mid-elevation conifer forests tend to be on smaller parcels, which
   fall below the larger size thresholds and the resulting potential
   reserve areas are fragmented. Then, for the area surrounding the two
   major highways that cross the Sierra Nevada, we identified seventeen
   road barrier areas and six urban conflict areas that pose major, but
   possibly mitigable barriers to wildlife movement at different time
   scales. We propose that (1) wildlife conflicts with highway traffic
   could be feasibly mitigated by installing wildlife overcrossings at the
   identified locations and (2) constraints on development rather than land
   acquisition are necessary to protect biodiversity. Finally, we suggest
   that a combination of highway crossings and restrictions on land-use may
   be the cheapest way to protect biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada. (c)

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {158},
Pages = {296-300},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many studies conducted a decade ago indicated that funding shortages
   were a major constraint on the effective management of China's nature
   reserves. However, with the rapid growth of China's economy, both the
   number of reserves and the corresponding financing of reserves have
   greatly increased. Based on data from a questionnaire survey conducted
   in 2011 at 47 national-level nature reserves (NNRs), we analyzed the
   financing of China's NNRs and compared it with six Southeast Asian
   countries. From secondary data, we also estimated the changes in the
   financing of NNRs and the changes in the government investment in nature
   reserves (NRs) at all levels. The findings revealed that operational
   expenditures in China's NNRs Were 5.19 USD/ha in 2009, ranking second
   among the seven countries in the survey and ranking third after
   adjustments for per capita gross domestic product. The total investment
   in NNRs increased by a factor of 2.3 over 1999 levels and reached 5.50
   USD/ha in 2009. From 1994 to 2005, government investment in nature
   reserves at all levels increased by a factor of 1.4. The financing of
   China's nature reserves has improved in general, and future investment
   should be more specifically targeted at NRs facing financial hardships.

Title = {Can nature tourism help finance protected areas in the Congo Basin?},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {332-338},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the debt-ridden, high-population-growth, resource-mining states of
   the Congo Basin, conservation of biodiversity is seldom the primary
   concern of national policy makers or of local resource users. Moreover,
   the recurring costs of managing protected areas and the opportunity
   costs of forgoing logging and farming to maintain protected areas are a
   substantial net drain on national and local economies. Consequently, it
   is becoming increasingly important that protected areas generate, from
   user fees or donor contributions, sufficient funds to offset the costs
   of maintaining them. Government and donor investment currently meet less
   than 30 per cent of the estimated recurring costs required to manage the
   protected -area network within central African countries effectively,
   and cover none of the growing opportunity costs. Nature tourism, the
   fastest growing sector of the \$US3 trillion (3 million million) a year
   global tourism industry, may offer a source of revenue to help fill this
   gap in funds. Congo Basin national parks and reserves harbour many
   charismatic animals (okapi, lowland gorilla, mandrills, bongo, forest
   elephant) that are likely to attract tourists, and as a result many
   protected-area managers are sinking capital into the development of
   tourist infrastructure. This paper reviews the evidence for ecotourism's
   capacity to generate revenue for protected-area management and appraises
   the financial viability of nature tourism in the Congo Basin.},

Title = {The Innovative Nature of Selected Polish Companies in the Energy Sector
   Compared to the Use of Renewable Energy Sources from a Financial and an
   Investor's Perspective},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Analysis of the energy sector from the micro perspective that relates to
   individual companies is much rarer than a macroeconomic analysis that
   concerns the power industry as a whole and its impact on the functioning
   of the economy. However, energy companies directly implement the
   government's energy policies and innovation strategies. Thus, this
   article attempts to answer the question concerning the relationships in
   three large energy companies operating in Poland (1) between the use of
   renewable resources for production and the innovative nature of a
   company, (2) between the use of renewable energy sources and the
   standing on the stock exchange and profitability. This study used
   multiple case studies, financial analysis indicators, a time series
   analysis, and an interdependence analysis. This study covers 2011-2022
   and allows consideration of long-term changes in domestic energy policy.
   Our findings suggest that there is a relationship between a company's
   investment activity and the use of renewable energy sources.
   Unfortunately, the scope of the use of RESs in these companies is small
   (from ca. 1\% to 15\%, which demonstrates the low progress of green
   transformation) and has negative correlations with the investors'
   assessment and profitability. In relation to innovation, the ratio of
   intangible assets to total assets was the highest for Tauron SA,
   increasing from 1.96\% to 5.16\%. Its material commitment to innovation
   is distinguishable from the other two companies. This is also the
   company with the highest share of RESs in energy production. The second
   place belongs to Enea SA with its ratio of intangible assets to total
   assets that increased from 0.72\% to 1.69\%. The ratio was lowest for
   PGE SA, increasing from 0.37\% to 1.47\%. The results and standing of
   the analyzed energy companies are strongly affected by energy policy
   amendments, including the improved status of coal and the re-oriented
   use of RESs (prioritizing solar energy over wind). As a result, these
   companies, despite the twelve-year period of the implementation of green
   transformation in the European Union, have achieved little on the path
   to sustainable energy. Therefore, achieving the goal of a zero-emission
   economy seems unlikely, since the renewable energy mix is still very
   slight and not diversified. Changes in energy policy are also not
   conducive to sectoral and economic innovation.},

Abstract = {I examine the impact of state-contingent allocation of creditor control
   rights on financial reporting. Using a discontinuity analysis, I find
   that firms' financial reporting becomes more conservative immediately
   after covenant violations and this effect persists for at least eight
   quarters. The conservatism effect is more pronounced when creditors
   possess greater bargaining power, when firms' operations are more
   volatile, and when creditors put Chief Restructuring Officers in place.
   My findings identify a specific channel through which debt financing
   shapes corporate financial reporting and provide direct evidence
   supporting the debt contracting explanation for conservatism posited in
   Watts (2003). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The complementary nature of audited financial reporting and corporate
   social responsibility disclosure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE \& INVESTMENT},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAY 19},
Abstract = {The confirmation hypothesis posits that the quality of audited financial
   reporting and nonfinancial disclosures, including CSR disclosure, are
   complementary. This study investigates the relationships between Big 4
   audit firms and audit fees and the level of corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) disclosure. Previous studies used the first two
   variables as proxies for higher commitment to financial reporting
   verification. However, the present study provides evidence that those
   variables can also be used as proxies for nonfinancial disclosure (i.e.
   CSR). The findings show that positive relationships between Big 4 and
   audit fees and CSR disclosure exist, particularly with the general,
   energy, and community CSR themes. Therefore, these findings provide
   evidence that both Big 4 audit firm and audit fees have the potential to
   explain a company's commitment to a higher level of CSR disclosure. The
   findings suggest that in the context of a country with a two-tier board
   system, low investor protection, and weak legal enforcement, regulations
   that enacted mandatory CSR disclosure for public companies are not
   sufficient to motivate them to disclose more. Companies' commitment to
   higher levels of audit verification on financial reporting plays that
   role and is a signal of such commitment. This study provides empirical
   evidence to investors and regulators that the quality of audited
   financial reporting matters and can be used as a confirmatory of the
   level of CSR disclosure.},

Abstract = {The resources invested by the forest owner in the nature conservation of
   the forest depend on the level of nature conservation, the efficiency of
   the production and the distribution of costs between the forest owner
   and other groups. The level of nature conservation is increasing Ly the
   change of values outside but also inside forestry, whereas a reduction
   of the level is caused by the reorganization of the state owned forests.
   The increase of the efficiency in securing nature values in the forest
   helps forestry to bring the costs down. This carl be achieved by
   integrating the god of nature conservation into multifunctional forestry
   and by cooperation with new environmentalist experts. The forest owner
   could get additional financial resources for nature values of his forest
   by selling new non-wood products. But such redistributional policy
   causes a lot more conflicts than the more traditional resistance of
   forestry against increasing the standards in nature conservation. A new
   active and less conflictional forest policy could focus on increasing
   the efficiency of multiple use forestry including nature values.},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {In many countries, catchment restoration is underfunded. This study aims
   to address whether household water pricing could be used as a mechanism
   for securing funds for catchment restoration. The objectives were to
   determine households' willingness to pay (WTP) for their existing water
   use, investigate whether institutional trust and municipal satisfaction
   influenced WTP, and establish whether aggregate consumer surplus at the
   municipal scale could cover the costs needed to finance catchment
   restoration. Surveys were conducted on 502 households in three
   metropolitan municipalities in South Africa. Contingent valuation
   revealed that average WTP for water was between 12 and 137\% more and 32
   and 73\% more than what households currently pay for water per month in
   Cape Town and eThekwini, respectively. Satisfaction with municipal
   service delivery positively influenced WTP, while institutional trust
   did not. In Cape Town, based on the aggregate WTP from the higher income
   categories, consumer surplus was 779 million South African Rand
   (ZAR)/year, more than double the estimated cost required to restore the
   catchment areas supplying water to the city over 30 years. In eThekwini,
   consumer surplus was equal to the amount needed over 30 years (250
   million ZAR/year). These results demonstrate the significant potential
   to raise water tariffs for higher income households in metropolitan
   municipalities.HIGHLIGHTSDomestic water users in two metropolitan
   municipalities were willing to pay significantly more for their water
   than current prices. This consumer surplus could cover a significant
   proportion of the costs required to restore catchment areas. In the
   third municipality, willingness to pay was lower as a result of low
   satisfaction with service delivery. Generating finance from water
   tariffs depends on functioning institutions.},

   sustainability by filling gaps in the knowledge on viable business,
   financing, and governance models for nature-based solutions. Through two
   case studies, we provide empirical illustrations for business models
   based on nature-based solutions that are both viable and scalable. We
   confront the financial and governance challenges identified in the
   literature with empirical evidence that is grounded in a specific urban
   territory (the cities of Montreal and Brussels) and a well-identified
   type of nature-based solutions (the sourcing of sustainable materials
   from natural local ecosystems). Given the relative novelty and absence
   of comprehensive scientific accounts about the emergence, current state
   and future potential of the local wood movement, another important
   contribution of this paper is to characterize local wood businesses.},
