Abstract = {The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) challenged signatory
   countries to seek and encourage new financial resources, including
   private-sector resources, to implement the objectives of the Convention.
   During the past decade, pioneering businesses have succeeded at making
   money while conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. What lessons
   have we learned! How can we speed up the adoption of
   biodiversity-friendly business activities' Where and how can additional
   private investment for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use be
   found! To answer these questions, this article reviews why biodiversity
   conservation needs private-sector finance. It defines the beneficial
   links between business and biodiversity; presents the business rationale
   for financing conservation and sustainable use; identifies who is
   currently investing in these businesses; and outlines the conditions
   necessary to attract considerably more amounts of private-sector
   financing for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.},

Abstract = {One of the often-cited challenges in biodiversity conservation is
   financing. But publications on financing are mostly confined to specific
   financial mechanisms, regions and actors. Fewer attempts have been made
   to find overall trends. Through a thematic review of 64 peer-reviewed
   articles, covering different disciplines and published since 2010, this
   study found three dominant themes recurring around the topic of
   biodiversity financing: underfunding, inefficient funding distribution
   and the pursuit for innovative financial mechanisms. Estimates of the
   funding gap are much higher than previously calculated and continuously
   increasing given the acceleration of new threats. Proposals for better
   targeting of available finances advocate for the use of priority
   protocols focussed on objectivity and efficiency. However, in practice
   funding allocation does not seem to follow objective indicators and
   remains quite inconsistent with conservation needs. This analysis shows
   that at the core of innovative financial mechanisms are new strategic
   networks between governments, civil society and businesses.
   Understanding these new networks is crucial for better capturing the
   patterns of pooling, mixing and directing financial flows, and the
   subsequent implications for policy and prioritization criteria. This
   paper argues that theories focusing on networks and flows could present
   a useful perspective for future studies on biodiversity financing.},

Abstract = {The ecological support of our modern society is not different in its
   functional aspects from the one of any historical moments. Biodiversity
   is recognized as an important condition of the ecological functionality

   the latest assessment enlightens worrying trends and the need for urgent
   action. Consequently new approaches and new mechanisms are needed for
   preserving biodiversity. Our paper explore the architecture of financial
   instruments proposed and used for biodiversity protection in order to
   find common features that could be harnessed for the development of a

   does biodiversity disclosure affect firms' financial performance?},
Journal = {FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {This study aims to contribute to the existing business strategy and the
   environment literature by exploring how biodiversity disclosure affects
   the financial performance of firms. The study employs the content
   analysis of a sample of 100 Fortune Global companies for 3 years, after
   developing a comprehensive index to measure the quality of disclosure.
   Then normality, correlation, and multiple linear regression model and
   its estimation using ordinary least squares are performed to measure the
   impact of biodiversity disclosure on the financial performance of
   companies. In addition, the Hausman test is used to check the robustness
   of the study. The study results reveal a relationship between
   biodiversity disclosure and financial performance measured by return on
   assets and a stock's price-to-book ratio. Biodiversity disclosure has a
   positive relationship with return on assets at a significance level
   below 5\%. While biodiversity disclosure has a positive relationship
   with stock price/ book value per share, they are not statistically
   significant at a significance level of 5\%. The sample represents only a
   small proportion of a larger population. The study only investigated
   Global 100 firms with different sectors and countries for 3 years. This
   study provides an opportunity to learn about the effect of the
   disclosure of practices associated with managing biodiversity and
   extinction risks through preparing a quality index of biodiversity and
   extinction disclosure and examining the relationship between
   biodiversity disclosure and the financial performance of firms by the
   prepared index. This study can be considered a contribution to the flow
   of accounting research about biodiversity and extinction. A few studies
   examine the effect of biodiversity disclosure. The study is among the
   first to examine how biodiversity disclosure affects the financial
   performance of firms. The results of this study inform firms and the
   academic literature about the economic consequences of biodiversity
   disclosure where biodiversity disclosure has a positive effect on firms'
   financial performance. The study evidence appears to be robust there is
   no endogeneity problem.},

Abstract = {The conservation or sustainable use of biological diversity presents
   special challenges for policy-makers because of its complex nature and
   the difficulties associated with identifying the underlying causes that
   lead to biodiversity loss. As such, it is often necessary that a range
   of incentive measures are utilised to ensure both the private and the
   public benefits of its conservation or sustainable use are realised.
   Incentive measures available for this purpose include economic
   incentives (such as taxes, charges, tradable use rights, and subsidies),
   regulatory measures (such as development or access restrictions), and
   the provision of relevant information and sufficient institutional
   capacity. While many of the direct use values of biodiversity are
   privately appropriable given a clear assignment of property rights and
   the existence of markets, other financing methods are often necessary
   for the realisation of other values, such as indirect use values,
   non-use values and option values. This paper expands the analysis in the
   Handbook of Incentive Measures for Biodiversity: Design and
   Implementation (OECD, 1999) developed under the responsibility of the
   OECD Expert Group on Economic Aspects of Biodiversity to discuss some of
   the methods available for financing incentive measures for the
   conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Where appropriate,
   case studies of experiences in OECD countries are drawn upon to provide
   practical examples of the financing and implementation of incentive
   measures. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Should biodiversity offsets help finance underfunded Protected Areas?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {191},
Pages = {819-826},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since the Convention on Biological Diversity was agreed upon at the Rio
   Earth Summit, global Protected Area (PA) coverage has increased whereas
   commensurable financial commitments to manage PAs have not. Here, we
   question whether biodiversity offsets should act as a complementary
   funding mechanism where funding for PAs is inadequate. Based on the
   additionality concept that underpins offsetting, biodiversity offsets
   set in PAs could be considered as not additional since PAs are already
   protected by legal or other means, and in theory should be adequately
   financed and managed. In practice however, many PAs are under increasing
   threat due to a lack of sufficient funding for staffing, infrastructure
   and other basic operational necessities, which renders their management
   ineffective, resulting in further loss of biodiversity. In such cases,
   we argue that additionality from a financial perspective can be
   demonstrated, opening up the opportunity for offset financing to provide
   enhanced protection of PAs. Even so, the use of offsets for PA financing
   is not straightforward due to the introduction of new risks to existing
   challenges that offsets face in general. We address four key challenges
   and highlight three advantages of using offset finance for improving PA
   management We end by questioning whether the use of offset finance can
   deliver high quality biodiversity offsets through existing PAs, and what
   this might mean for biodiversity conservation more broadly. We infer
   that this mechanism has the potential to boost financing for
   conservation and help governments meet some of their national and
   international biodiversity conservation commitments, including
   realisation of Aichi Target 11. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Designing a global mechanism for intergovernmental biodiversity
   financing},
Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol display a
   broad international consensus for biodiversity conservation and
   equitable benefit sharing. Yet, the Aichi biodiversity targets show a
   lack of progress and thus indicate a need for additional action such as
   enhanced and better targeted financial resource mobilization. To date,
   no global financial burden-sharing instrument has been proposed.
   Developing a global-scale financial mechanism to support biodiversity
   conservation through intergovernmental transfers, we simulate three
   allocation designs: ecocentric, socioecological, and anthropocentric. We
   analyze the corresponding incentives needed to reach the Aichi target of
   terrestrial protected area coverage by 2020. Here we show that the
   socioecological design would provide the strongest median incentive for
   states which are farthest from achieving the target. Our proposal
   provides a novel concept for global biodiversity financing, which can
   serve as a starting point for more specific policy dialogues on
   intergovernmental burden and benefit-sharing mechanisms to halt
   biodiversity loss.},

   Closing the financing gap between what is currently spent and what is

   provide, is estimated to exceed hundreds of billions per year. Yet there

Title = {Bringing tropical forest biodiversity conservation into financial
   accounting calculation},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {688-714},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to examine how the biodiversity comprising a
   tropical forest ecosystem is being protected as a result of having its
   conservation brought into financial accounting calculations by
   constructing a greenhouse gas emissions offset product to sell on the
   voluntary over-the-counter carbon markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research examines a single embedded
   case study of a biodiversity conservation project in Kenya. The
   resulting discussion builds upon the existing accounting and
   organisation studies literature regarding the construction of markets.
   Findings - Whilst the case examined does successfully bring tropical
   forest biodiversity conservation into the financial accounting
   calculations of the sellers and buyers of the offset product, via
   processes of objectification and singularisation, there are considerable
   accounting obstacles to constructing a calculative mechanism capable of
   achieving this on a global scale to facilitate financing of the
   conservation of all the world's remaining tropical forest biodiversity.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the debate on accounting
   for biodiversity by examining market construction as a theoretical
   framework for turning the loss/conservation of biodiversity from an
   externality into an entity that is taken into account in organisations'
   calculations of profit and loss.},

Abstract = {This study presents a short bibliometric analysis of biodiversity
   finance, exposing a literature fragmented across researchers,

   Conservation Finance, and Ecosystem Finance prominent. Thematic emphasis
   revolves around biodiversity challenges and the inefficiency of
   financial mechanisms in addressing them. Our analysis reveals an
   exploitable gap in the lack of finance-led solutions. We advocate for
   recognising finance's pivotal role in tackling biodiversity challenges,
   emphasising capital access facilitation and risk mitigation.
   Collaborative efforts between finance and other disciplines are crucial

Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1472-1496},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {This paper addresses two interlinked problems in sustainable development
   and suggests a methodology to resolve them. The first is the reduction
   of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide. The
   second is the maintenance of biodiversity. Current carbon financing and
   environmental stewardship mechanisms underwhelm, often diluting intended
   positive effects. Most existing carbon credits do not have protection
   after 40 years, placing projects substantially beneath the C02 radiative
   forcing cycle. This paper presents the `Balance' approach to sustainable
   development, including contractual principles ensuring C02 reduction,
   biodiversity enhancement and financial accountability. We describe two
   novel measures: a carbon calculator for commercial entities, and a new
   metric, the Balance Unit, combining biodiversity creation with carbon
   credits. A case study, spanning over 20 years at the Forest of Marston
   Vale, is then presented. It finds an increase in tree cover, CO2
   sequestration, reduction in agricultural GHG emissions, sulphur dioxide
   and particulate matter absorption, and annual local economic benefits
   totalling UK12.83 pound million. Expository detail regarding the
   `Planting Principles' practised at Marston Vale is also provided. We
   argue that the Balance methodology, especially the Balance Unit, enables
   greater measurement reliability and long-term efficacy for maintaining
   biodiversity and reducing GHG emissions than current carbon financing
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Many financing decisions continue to exacerbate global biodiversity
   loss, despite a growing understanding of the economic and financial
   risks of biodiversity loss. Applying Coase's financial decision-making
   theory based on cost, revenues, and risks, the article analyzes
   literature and current developments of biodiversity finance and green
   finance to evaluate why financial decision-making is incentivized to
   ignore biodiversity risks and mostly fails to maximize biodiversity
   conservation or nature-positive finance. Based on the identified gaps,
   the article develops four principles to integrate biodiversity into
   financial decision-making: (1) regulation must set limits on nature's
   exploitation, as finance only values limited aspects of nature as
   ``bankable,{''} while the destruction of other parts are without
   negative or positive value to the investor; (2) biodiversity-related
   financial risk evaluation needs focus on local risks due to the local
   nature of biodiversity impacts and dependencies (in comparison, e.g., to
   climate finance's global risks); (3) scale biodiversity finance
   utilizing its secondary benefits, particularly in conjunction with
   climate finance; (4) biodiversity finance development needs to be co-led
   and championed by financial decision-makers.
   This article contributes to the emerging literature on biodiversity
   finance and green finance for sustainable development with implications
   for policy makers and standard setters.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {261-273},

Abstract = {Biodiversity loss is a serious and ongoing global environmental problem.
   Economic instruments in biodiversity policies can contribute towards
   reconciling the conservation costs encountered at local level with the
   benefits of biodiversity conservation at higher levels of governance,
   from regional and national levels up to the global level. This paper
   outlines the theoretical foundations of fiscal transfers in conservation
   policies and also offers a concise account of existing international
   experience and future prospects. The recently amended Portuguese Local
   Finances Law (LFL) of 2007, with its groundbreaking new article on the
   promotion of local sustainability, is analysed in terms of the
   significance of fiscal transfers for municipal budgets. It is compared
   with its predecessor law, highlighting changes in fiscal revenues for
   selected municipalities in the country in relation to their designated
   conservation areas. The analysis shows that these ecological fiscal
   transfers can be significant for those municipalities with a large
   proportion of land under protected status. However, because it also
   introduces a considerable number of changes to the Portuguese fiscal
   transfer scheme, the ecological impact of the new LFL is difficult to
   grasp due to the presence of several crossover effects. The results
   obtained offer significant insights both for improving the Portuguese
   LFL and for designing new ecological fiscal transfer schemes. (C) 2011

Title = {Bankrolling biodiversity: The politics of philanthropic conservation
   finance in Chile},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The role of philanthropic capital in biodiversity conservation is
   rapidly changing. Philanthropists increasingly seek to bankroll
   solutions to the biodiversity crisis, scaling up the size of their
   ambitions and gifts to help close what scientists and policymakers call
   the ``biodiversity financing gap.{''} This paper interrogates the rising
   prominence of philanthropic capital in conservation governance, focusing
   on a class of actors I call ``philanthro-environmentalists.{''} Unlike
   big, international NGOs and philanthrocapitalists,
   philanthro-environmentalists do not engage market-based, for-profit
   approaches to finance conservation. Rather, they engage a ``dollars for
   policy{''} approach that leverages the power of their philanthropy to
   improve public conservation outcomes. Taking Chile as a case, I trace
   how a transnational network of philanthro-environmentalists is using a
   novel mechanism known as Project Finance for Permanence to exact
   substantial political and fiscal commitments from the state in exchange
   for substantive philanthropic support for a mega conservation initiative
   in Chilean Patagonia. I argue that Project Finance for Permanence
   targets policymaking as the primary site of philanthropic intervention,
   affording philanthro-environmentalists greater control over state
   conservation governance. Yet, I also argue that this case raises serious
   questions about the limits and implications of leveraging philanthropic
   capital to solve public environmental problems. Bridging literatures on
   conservation governance and conservation finance, the paper contributes
   new conceptual insights into the evolving dynamics of philanthropy-state
   relations in an age of biodiversity crisis.},

Title = {Finance for nature: A global estimate of public biodiversity investments},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
   will meet at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP 15) to carve out a
   post-2020 framework for global biodiversity conservation. Finance will
   be among the priority concerns. No global estimates of public
   biodiversity investments are in the peer reviewed literature. The
   methodology developed by the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)
   provides a means for countries to account systematically for their
   biodiversity expenditures. Importantly, budget lines that intentionally,
   but secondarily, affect biodiversity outcomes are assigned a percentage
   at which they can be attributed to biodiversity. A sample of thirty
   countries facilitated the construction of a panel to predict public
   biodiversity investments at a global level. Here we show that global
   public biodiversity investments have increased steadily to an average of
   US\$121 billion invested annually from 2008-2017, or 0.19-0.25\% of
   global GDP. Our data not only indicate an increasing trend in total
   biodiversity investment, but also an increase in the percentage of total
   public domestic investment dedicated to biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The market mechanisms intended to facilitate lower-cost realization of
   the Kyoto Protocol's goals of lowering net emission of greenhouse gases
   can also help advance the goals of the Convention on Biological
   Diversity. By acknowledging the ability of carbon sinks, such as forests
   and soils, to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide, and by
   including these activities in the international emissions trading
   system, the Kyoto Protocol provides a new source of financial support
   for enhancement and protection of biological habitat. The magnitude of
   the global benefits for biodiversity from this mechanism will be
   significantly enhanced if the credit trading system includes forest
   regeneration and protection in developing countries and the carbon
   benefits of management practices that lead to increased storage of
   carbon in agricultural soils. While the impediments to including these
   two groups of activities, such as measurement difficulties, need further
   work to be resolved, they are not qualitatively different from the
   challenges present in all aspects of monitoring environmental protection
   programs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and through
   the conservation, sustainable management, and enhancement of carbon
   stocks (REDD+) offers unprecedented potential funding for forest
   conservation and associated biodiversity. However, as a growing number
   of biodiversity conservation projects link with carbon emissions
   mitigation efforts, they might also be exposed to significant financial
   risks. REDD+ projects currently face uncertainty over future demand for
   carbon credits, the potential for inconsistent donor support in the
   long-term, carbon market volatility, investor preference for low-cost
   emissions mitigation over cobenefits, and the possibility of a
   short-lived REDD+ mechanism. The private sector is aware of the
   associated financial risks, which remain largely unaddressed within the
   conservation literature. Biodiversity conservationists need to identify
   a balance between maximizing near-term REDD+ opportunities and
   insulating themselves from long-term financial risks. We describe some
   of the prospective financial risks for biodiversity conservation efforts
   linked with REDD+, and propose initial strategies for financial
   resilience.},

Title = {Best-practice biodiversity safeguards for Belt and Road Initiative's
   financiers},

Abstract = {With thousands of projects being built along eight transcontinental
   corridors, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is driving the global
   infrastructure boom. BRI is likely to have a sizeable biodiversity
   footprint as its corridors overlap several priority areas for
   conservation and 150,000 km(2) of critical habitat. Biodiversity
   safeguards for the initiative therefore warrant scrutiny. Biodiversity
   safeguards are policies or standards (adopted by regulators, project
   proponents or financiers) that specify biodiversity impact mitigation
   measures. Here we examine a key source of safeguards-lending
   requirements of BRI's financiers. We compare them with International
   Finance Corporation's Performance Standard 6, which is often regarded as
   international best practice and which requires projects affecting
   `critical habitat' to achieve a `net gain' of biodiversity through
   impact mitigation. We find that of the 65 financiers identified (35
   Chinese and 30 international), just 17 require biodiversity impact
   mitigation and 12 require a `net gain'. Among those with biodiversity
   safeguards, 16 are international, and despite the Chinese financiers
   accounting for over 90\% of BRI's financing (by quantum of investment),
   only 1 of the 35 we identified has biodiversity safeguards. Because most
   BRI finance is not subject to biodiversity safeguards, we conclude that
   potential impacts of BRI linear infrastructure projects may remain
   unmitigated, despite approximately 369,000 km(2) of critical and natural
   habitat occurring within the 25 km buffer zone of such projects. We
   therefore argue for urgent adherence to best-practice safeguards for all
   institutions financing the BRI.
   An analysis reveals only 17 out of 65 financiers require biodiversity
   impact mitigation measures, and overall the initiative falls short of
   international best practices},

   to South},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {43-55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The present paper analyzes self-enforcing biodiversity agreements (or
   coalitions) in a multi-country general equilibrium model. Governments
   split up all land in unprotected and protected land, and there are
   internationally traded consumption goods that use either protected or
   unprotected land as an input in production. Global biodiversity is
   increasing in aggregate protected land. The willingness-to-pay for
   biodiversity (conservation) is larger in the `rich' North than in the
   `poor' South. There is an international market on which governments and
   possibly a coalition of northern countries may demand and/or offer
   unprotected land for conversion into protected land. If a coalition
   exists, it turns out to be the only demander on that market, and its
   demand is increasing in coalition size. We investigate the formation of
   self-enforcing coalitions when governments and the coalition either take
   prices as given or exert market power. We find that there are no such
   coalitions, when external biodiversity benefits are large, but there may
   be self-enforcing coalitions, even large ones, if these benefits are
   sufficiently small. Furthermore, it is possible that the South suffers a
   welfare loss when a self-enforcing coalition of northern countries pays
   for biodiversity conservation in the South.},

Abstract = {It is generally recognized that addressing the ongoing loss of global
   biodiversity requires a substantial increase in funding for conservation
   activities, particularly in developing countries. An increasing interest
   in Payment Mechanisms for Ecosystem Services (PES) begs the question of
   whether a focus on developing payment mechanisms will also reduce the
   ongoing loss of global biodiversity. We review, firstly, current flows
   of funds for biodiversity conservation, including PES and other market
   mechanisms, and secondly, the opportunities and constraints of PES to
   contribute to biodiversity protection globally. We argue that PES can
   and should make an important contribution, but that it will not be
   sufficient to rely on PES alone to finance the actions necessary to
   substantially reduce biodiversity loss. In response to the identified
   constraints, we believe there is a need to develop additional funding
   mechanisms specifically targeted at biodiversity conservation.},

Title = {Global assessment of the biodiversity safeguards of development banks
   that finance infrastructure},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Infrastructure development is a major driver of biodiversity loss
   globally. With upward of US\$2.5 trillion in annual investments in
   infrastructure, the financial sector indirectly drives this biodiversity
   loss. At the same time, biodiversity safeguards (project-level
   biodiversity impact mitigation requirements) of infrastructure
   financiers can help limit this damage. The coverage and harmonization of
   biodiversity safeguards are important factors in their effectiveness and
   therefore warrant scrutiny. It is equally important to examine the
   extent to which these safeguards align with best-practice principles for
   biodiversity impact mitigation outlined in international policies, such
   as that of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We
   assessed the biodiversity safeguards of public development banks and
   development finance institutions for coverage, harmonization, and
   alignment with best practice. We used Institute of New Structural
   Economics and Agence Francaise de Developpement's global database to
   identify development banks that invest in high-biodiversity-footprint
   infrastructure and have over US\$500 million in assets. Of the 155
   banks, 42\% (n = 65) had biodiversity safeguards. Of the existing
   safeguards, 86\% (56 of 65) were harmonized with International Finance
   Corporation (IFC) Performance Standard 6 (PS6). The IFC PS6 (and by
   extension the 56 safeguard policies harmonized with it) had high
   alignment with international best practice in biodiversity impact
   mitigation, whereas the remaining 8 exhibited partial alignment,
   incorporating few principles that clarify the conditions for effective
   biodiversity offsetting. Given their dual role in setting benchmarks and
   leveraging private finance, infrastructure financiers in development
   finance need to adopt best-practice biodiversity safeguards if the tide
   of global biodiversity loss is to be stemmed. The IFC PS6, if
   strengthened, can act as a useful template for other financier
   safeguards. The high degree of harmonization among safeguards is
   promising, pointing to a potential for diffusion of practices.},

Title = {Risks to global biodiversity and Indigenous lands from China's overseas

Journal = {NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION},

Pages = {1520+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {China has become one of the world's largest lenders in overseas
   development finance. Development projects, such as roads, railways and
   power plants, often drive biodiversity loss and infringe on Indigenous
   lands, yet the risks implicit in China's overseas development finance
   are poorly understood. Here we examine the extent to which projects
   financed by China's policy banks between 2008 and 2019 occur within and
   adjacent to areas where large-scale investment can present considerable
   risks to biodiversity and Indigenous peoples. Further, we compare these
   risks with those posed by similar projects financed by the World Bank,
   previously the world's largest source of development finance. We found
   that 63\% of China-financed projects overlap with critical habitats,
   protected areas or Indigenous lands, with up to 24\% of the world's
   threatened birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians potentially impacted
   by the projects. Hotspots of the risks are primarily distributed in
   northern sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of South America.
   Overall, China's development projects pose greater risks than those of
   the World Bank, particularly within the energy sector. These results
   provide an important global outlook of socio-ecological risks that can
   guide strategies for greening China's development finance around the
   world.
   The authors assess the risks to global biodiversity and Indigenous lands
   arising from projects financed by China's policy banks between 2008 and
   2019, and compare that with the risks associated with similar projects
   financed by the World Bank.},

Title = {Financial compensation for biodiversity conservation in Ba Be National
   Park of Northern Vietnam},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {92-100},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Terrestrial biodiversity is seriously threatened by an increasing
   deforestation rate. Financial incentives can stimulate local people to
   participate in biodiversity conservation. A common approach to derive
   financial compensation is estimating the opportunity costs arising from
   the adoption of conservation friendly land-use practices. Assuming that
   farmers are risk averse, we used a decision-making under uncertainty
   approach to derive financial compensation for local people living in and
   around Ba Be National Park, Vietnam. Moderately risk-averse farmers need
   US\$ 228 ha(-1) year(-1) financial compensation for the protection of
   natural forests in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones,
   whereas the required compensation reaches US\$ 334 ha(-1) year(-1) in
   the Strict Protection Zone. These compensation payments were derived by
   comparing financial returns from natural forests with those of the most
   profitable land use (maize). Compensation amounts decrease to US\$ 130
   ha-(1) year(-1) in the Ecological Rehabilitation and Buffer Zones and to
   US\$ 218 ha(-1) year(-1) in the Strict Protection Zone, when considering
   diversification strategy. Derived financial compensations assume that
   farms comprise 20\% croplands and 80\% forest. We conclude that
   compensation amounts vary with farmers' risk preferences, whether or not
   diversification strategy is considered, and the level of protection of a
   given area. 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

   increase progress toward its closure. In this review of biodiversity
   finance, we first provide a brief historical overview of the
   biodiversity finance gap, next describe current methodologies designed
   to identify, quantify, and bridge the gap in the public and private
   sectors, two sections reviewing current public and private sector
   efforts to close the gap follow, and a discussion of future directions
   and trends concludes. From asset management to biodiversity credits to
   crowdfunding, and from debt for nature swaps to environmental fiscal
   transfer and green bonds, we highlight efforts in the global south to
   address their biodiversity finance needs and meet their commitments to
   the Convention on Biological Diversity. Research on subsidies harmful to
   nature, more effectively connecting biodiversity outcomes to financial
   investments, identifying finance mechanisms that generate climate and
   biodiversity co-benefits, and further innovation in private sector
   solutions like biodiversity credits and offsets are future priorities
   and perhaps a research agenda in this sphere. We hope this review
   generates discussion and a research agenda within the biodiversity
   finance community to help us fulfil the ambitious goals of the GBF by
   2030.},

Abstract = {World governments have committed to halting human-induced extinctions
   and safeguarding important sites for biodiversity by 2020, but the
   financial costs of meeting these targets are largely unknown. We
   estimate the cost of reducing the extinction risk of all globally
   threatened bird species (by >= 1 International Union for Conservation of
   Nature Red List category) to be U. S. \$0.875 to \$1.23 billion annually
   over the next decade, of which 12\% is currently funded. Incorporating
   threatened nonavian species increases this total to U. S. \$3.41 to
   \$4.76 billion annually. We estimate that protecting and effectively
   managing all terrestrial sites of global avian conservation significance
   (11,731 Important Bird Areas) would cost U. S. \$65.1 billion annually.
   Adding sites for other taxa increases this to U. S. \$76.1 billion
   annually. Meeting these targets will require conservation funding to
   increase by at least an order of magnitude.},

Title = {Learning from Biodiversity: Is Diversity in Financial Ecosystems
   Important for Economic Growth and Stability?},
Journal = {IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 16},
Abstract = {We propose a new measure of financial system diversity inspired from
   biodiversity research and explore its potential benefits for growth and
   stability. Our measure captures the relative contributions of various
   financial system constituents as well as their interrelationships. For a
   sample of 61 countries, we find that diversity in financial
   ``ecosystems{''} differs widely across countries and over time. Our
   evidence shows that diversity has a significant growth enhancing effect
   that is robust to other financial development controls. Diversity also
   reduces growth volatility and mitigates the negative effect of systemic
   banking crises on growth. The effect is both statically and economically
   significant across various construction methodologies for the financial
   diversity index. Our results suggest that financial policies that
   promote diversity within the financial system could be a powerful tool
   to promote sustainable growth while potentially improving resilience and
   stability.},

Title = {Finance and biodiversity conservation: insights from rhinoceros
   conservation and the first wildlife conservation bond},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-99},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Rhino Bond is the first financial instrument dedicated to protecting
   a species. The Bond allows investors to invest in the conservation of
   the black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, with the amount of money returned
   by the investment depending on whether rhinoceros numbers increase (and
   by how much). In this paper we focus on how the Bond was brought into
   being. We draw on an analysis of organizational reports along with data
   collected from interviews with key informants to investigate the roles
   of the various stakeholders in the Bond, how species and sites were
   selected, the motivations and experiences of the stakeholders and the
   involvement of stakeholders in decision-making. We found that although
   conservation actors are attracted by the potential for new funding, they
   have experienced challenges navigating complex financial instruments.
   The needs of financial actors often dictated decision-making, with
   implications for the species and sites chosen for the Bond. As profits
   are tied to an increase in population size of a specific species (which
   needs to be monitored), the instrument has favoured large and easily
   counted species and populations. Only some sites were able to meet the
   stringent conditions of financial instruments, including metrics on
   financial sustainability. We argue that the dominance of financial
   principles and motives means that not all species or sites will be
   viable candidates for investment and that conservation finance should
   not be seen as a panacea.},

Journal = {BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {353-368},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Impact investments have the dual goals of generating profit and
   environmental and/or social impact from the same project or enterprise.
   This article examines recent impact investments in biodiversity
   conservation-specifically, debt finance in the form of conventional
   bonds and impact bonds. The proceeds of these bonds finance projects
   aiming to enhance forest management, sustainable agriculture, endangered
   species protection, ecosystem service provision, and nature-based
   solutions to climate change such as REDD+. The article scrutinises
   whether these dual goals are achievable by evaluating the financial
   risks and impact risks within each bond's theory of change. Risks stem
   from projects with vague cashflow forecasts, project sites with low or
   ambiguous threat statuses, and simplified impact metrics that may
   measure activities or outputs-rather than impact. Risk mitigation
   strategies involve using baselines and counterfactuals to establish
   additionality, and guarantors to protect investors if revenues are
   insufficient. Implications for biodiversity management and for-profit
   conservation are discussed.},

Title = {Biodiversity loss and climate change interactions: financial stability
   implications for central banks and financial supervisors},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {763-781},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Financial risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss are
   currently being addressed in a largely siloed manner. Neglecting their
   interconnections, however, may lead to `blind spots' and misestimations
   of systemic financial risk, potentially undermining progress on both
   climate finance policy and emerging policy on biodiversity-related
   financial risks (BRFR). In particular, the `risk measurement-based'
   approach dominating climate finance policy, which is now being taken up
   to address BRFR, is poorly equipped to address the radical uncertainty
   that characterises both types of risks. Furthermore, many BRFR may
   materalise over a more immediate horizon than climate risks. In this
   paper, we examine how central banks and financial supervisors are
   approaching the topic of BRFR in relation to climate-related financial
   risk. We argue that policymakers should focus upon the broader concept
   of systemic environmental-financial risks to account for the
   interactions and trade-offs between both domains of biodiversity and
   climate change. Instead of seeking evidence of financial materiality
   before acting, focusing on how the financial system is actively
   facilitating direct drivers of environmental damage offers a way for
   financial policymakers to assess potential sources of such risks on the
   basis of information available today. In turn, policy interventions
   should aim to reduce harmful flows of finance that may lead to the
   crossing of dangerous ecological tipping points. Key policy insights
   Financial policymakers need to think beyond siloes, and act on a
   precautionary basis to manage climate- and biodiversity-related
   financial risks concurrently. Financial authorities, coordinating with
   relevant government departments, should define business activities that
   are most harmful to climate and biodiversity, especially those
   contributing to ecological tipping points, e.g. activities linked to
   tropical deforestation, which will damage both domains. To aid
   transparency and supervisory risk assessment, financial supervisors
   could require the mandatory disclosure of portfolio composition, risk
   management, and due diligence procedures relating to the financing of
   identified harmful activities. Financial regulators could use their
   toolkits to discourage the financing of such activities, e.g. by
   applying punitive capital requirements. This approach may require
   greater coordination between central banks and other government
   departments to maintain democratic legitimacy and support existing
   central bank mandates.},

   They can reduce the current financial gap for biodiversity conservation
   in the country. Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental
   services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately
   US\$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in
   environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also
   very high, with estimates from US\$ 1 to US\$ 20 billion up to 2030.
   Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving
   biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either
   through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the
   financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In
   Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties,
   and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges
   for large-scale implementation of these instruments.},

   conservation programmes of Mediterranean agro-biodiversity},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {160-167},

Abstract = {The Apulia region, in southern Italy, has a long tradition of vine
   cultivation for winemaking. However, in the last decades, regional
   farmers substituted local landraces with more productive non-native
   varieties. Regional institutions introduced regulations aimed at
   preventing the extinction of the local and historic ecotypes in the form
   of financial subsidies to reduce planting and operating costs.
   In this paper, we compared the financial sustainability of a
   non-autochthone, a typical and a landrace variety for wine production,
   in intensive and semi-extensive cultivation systems, with and without
   financial supports. The analysis referred to northern Apulia,
   considering a 26-year economic duration of vineyards. The results showed
   that the non-autochthone variety was more profitable due to its higher
   yields, while investments regarding landrace-based plants were
   characterized by lower economic convenience, despite financial aid.
   These estimates shed light on the effectiveness and efficacy of the
   present regulations, as well as on the development of future strategies
   for a better restoration of vine landraces in Apulia. This new framework
   will help to increase fanners' profits, improve environmental conditions
   for the community and ensure higher quality, security and safety for
   consumers.},

Abstract = {China has emerged as the largest overseas financier of hydropower in
   low-income countries. Since hydro-power dams pose risks to biodiversity,
   an examination of potential biodiversity impacts of Chinese projects is
   critically needed. We conducted a biodiversity risk and safeguards
   assessment of Chinese-funded dams being built in Belt and Road
   Initiative (BRI) countries. We identified 49 Chinese-funded dams in 18
   BRI coun-tries. They pose a risk to 14 free-flowing rivers, 12
   critically endangered freshwater fish species, and 134 km2 of critical
   terrestrial habitat. While the overall biodiversity risk is high, dams
   funded by key Chinese financiers namely, China Development Bank and
   China Export-import Bank, do not pose a higher risk compared with
   multilateral development bank (MDB)-funded dams. Chinese regulators do
   not have binding biodiversity safeguard requirements for overseas
   projects while the corresponding requirements of MDBs fail to address
   riverine impact. Robust safeguards and basin-wide planning will allow
   China to minimize the biodiversity risks of its hydropower portfolio,
   while still decarbonizing its overseas energy financing.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of conservation organizations is determined in part by

   these changes through their financial behaviors, focusing on a sample of
   90 biodiversity conservation nonprofits and the largest individual
   organization (The Nature Conservancy; TNC). For the 90 sampled
   organizations, an analysis of financial ratios derived from tax return
   data revealed little response to economic conditions. Similarly, more
   detailed examination of conservation expenditures and land acquisition
   practices of TNC revealed only one significant relationship with
   economic conditions: TNC accepted a greater proportion of conservation
   easements as donated in more difficult economic conditions. Our results
   suggest that the financial behaviors of US biodiversity conservation
   nonprofits are unresponsive to economic conditions.},

Pages = {101-115},

Abstract = {The extent to which an international mechanism to reduce emissions from
   deforestation and degradation (REDD+) can also provide biodiversity
   co-benefits will depend on whether the mechanism results in the
   retention of forest in countries harboring substantial biodiversity.
   Countries' decisions whether or not to participate in REDD+ will be
   influenced by their national reference level of emissions from
   deforestation, below which their verified emissions can be credited as
   reductions. In this article, we explore the reduction in extinctions of
   forest species achieved under four alternative national reference level
   designs and three alternative levels of finance for REDD+. We use an
   85-country partial equilibrium model and species-area relationships to
   estimate extinction rates for 2,472 nationally endemic forest-dependent
   amphibian, bird and mammal species if a REDD+ mechanism had been in
   place during 2005-2010. Our results indicate that elements of REDD+ that
   are most effective for climate change mitigation-greater finance
   combined with reference levels which reduce leakage by promoting broad
   participation across countries with both high and low historical
   deforestation rates-also offer the greatest benefits for biodiversity
   conservation.},

   analysis: A case study of an Indian state},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Timely implementation of State Biodiversity Action Plan (SBAP) requires
   adequate financial resources for the corresponding implementing
   agencies. In India, the existing SBAPs have attempted to measure the
   required budget to implement the action plans, but an assessment on
   public financing, especially budgetary provisions and relevant
   expenditures is lacking. No attempts were made to estimate the
   biodiversity-relevant expenditures present in the state that are not
   tagged as SBAP activities. The study proposes a unique method of
   analysing the public expenditure related to SBAP activities and
   subsequently finds the potential gaps to be fulfilled through external
   funding. The methodology is a combination of top-down and bottom-up
   analysis of public financing to investigate the Annual Financial
   Statements and CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) reports on
   Appropriation Account with schemes implemented in the State, year wise.
   A gap assessment is done to identify sector-specific funding requirement
   to implement the SBAP. The findings from Punjab state case study could
   be utilized by other States to fathom the financial resources required
   for SBAP implementation and to what extent, States would be able to
   support the SBAP. The study also recommends the inclusion of PES in the
   SBAP budget.},

Abstract = {With the increasing human pressure on ecosystems, it is necessary to use
   tools to reduce the effects of fragmentation, increasing the gene flow
   of species, and the resilience of forest fragments and conservation
   units, and the ecological corridors (EC) have been noteworthy.
   Therefore, the present study aims to identify the best way to create an
   ecological corridor using spatial analysis techniques and calculate the
   purchase cost for its implementation between two important conservation
   units in the metropolitan region of Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil. For this, information plans (IPs) that reflected on the
   favorability for the displacement of fauna and the purchase of private
   properties were used, such as land use and vegetation cover, land use
   conflict due to slope, light pollution, legally protected areas, and
   purchase cost of these areas for EC implementation. The IPs were
   weighted by Analytical Hierarchical Process and the EC was obtained by
   the least cost path model. The estimated value for acquisition of
   private properties in the study area for EC implementation was
   US\$175,028.91 (United States dollar). Therefore, the method is an
   excellent tool for decisionmaking by public authorities and
   implementation of ecological corridors, since it allows inferring the
   market value for its implementation considering the favorability of
   areas for the passage of fauna.},

Abstract = {Stand growth, competition, stability, and wood quality are usually the
   focus of traditional investigations into stand treatment. Although
   needed for a stand-adequate intermediate harvest, they are not entirely
   satisfactory as they are superimposed by crucial economic influences
   such as the timber market, prices of production factors, objectives of
   the forest owners and societal demands. Due to the fact that thinning is
   future-oriented, the decisions taken in this context are controlled by a
   dynamic magnitude: Changes in the natural environment have to be
   complied with in the same way as changes in economic premises and the
   forest owners' objectives.
   The financial analysis of thinning regimes is based on an intermediate
   investment theory, especially the FAUSTMANN formula as an integer
   construct. It aids in deducing the hypotheses. However, the analysis
   itself turns out to be problematic since the FAUSTMANN model relies on
   model assumptions by which the features of thinning regimes tend to be
   faded out rather than substantiated. Therefore, an attempt has been made
   to approach a solution to the problem by means of simulations.
   The stand simulator SILVA 2, simulating stand growth in dependence on
   various thinning regimes and at the same time calculating the costs and
   revenues for the individual operations, proved to be suitable. Hence,
   payments series may tie derived and holding values determined which are
   relevant to the decision to be taken. For the simulation experiments
   40-, 60-, 70-, and 90-year-old spruce stands were selected at the time
   the decision was taken. The variables involved were type of thinning,
   thinning intensity and interval as well as the guiding rate of return of
   the forest owners.
   The financial analysis was extended by including public services,
   demonstrated by the example of biodiversity. For this purpose the
   technique according to KLEMPERER was applied, which considers changes in
   biodiversity and the opportunity costs thus accruing.
   Finally, the ten statements derived from the simulations for the
   selection of optimal thinning regimes are presented for peer reviewal.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the nonlinear effect of nuclear energy,
   economic complexity, and financial development on biodiversity in France
   using the NARDL. Unlike other traditional proxies of ecological quality
   (CO2 and EF), this study utilized the ``Biodiversity habitat index{''}.
   The analysis revealed that positive shocks in nuclear energy led to
   sustainable biodiversity in France. Moreover, negative shocks from
   nuclear energy led to biodiversity losses both in the short and long
   term. Moreover, financial development and economic complexity were found
   to exhibit favorable conditions for biodiversity in the long term.
   Contrarily, economic growth accelerates biodiversity loss in France.
   Policymakers should endeavor to promote investments in nuclear energy,
   green finance, and implementation of climaterelated risk management
   frameworks.},

Title = {FinTech and sustainable financing for low carbon energy transitions: A
   biodiversity and natural resource perspective in BRICS economies},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {BRICS countries grapple with formidable challenges, declining
   biodiversity, and energy crises. This study ex-amines the transformative
   potential of financial technology and sustainable financing in driving
   low-carbon energy transitions. It aims to achieve two objectives: first,
   to investigate the effectiveness of FinTech and sus-tainable financing
   in driving low-carbon energy transitions; and second, to probe the
   relationship between these mechanisms and the imperatives of
   biodiversity and sustainable natural resource utilization in the context
   of BRICS economies. Through the application of advanced econometric
   techniques such as fully modified OLS (FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DOLS), fixed
   effect-OLS (FE-OLS), and Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR),
   this study investigates the impact of FinTech, sustainable financing,
   and biodiversity and natural resource utilization on low-carbon energy
   transitions. Our empirical findings underscore a robust, long-term
   co-integrating relationship among low-carbon energy advancement,
   financial technology, financial development, biodiversity preservation,
   and natural resource utilization. Notably, both FinTech innovations and
   accessible sustainable financing mechanisms positively influence the
   adoption of low-carbon energy practices. Moreover, economies rich in
   biodiversity and with higher income levels exhibit a strong inclination
   toward low-carbon energy sources. However, overreliance on natural
   resource extraction hampers the sustained adoption of low-carbon energy
   practices. This study recommends strategies that leverage FinTech and
   sustainable financing, while emphasizing the importance of safeguarding
   natural resources and promoting environmental management. These measures
   effectively address the energy crisis and foster policies and practices
   for low-carbon energy transitions.},

Title = {Is biodiversity-friendly coffee financially viable? An analysis of five
   different coffee production systems in western El Salvador},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {267-281},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The current trend for reducing shade cover in coffee plantations in
   northern Latin America has prompted concern among conservationists
   because of its potential implications for the loss of biodiversity. To
   help reverse such a trend, a project has been launched to promote
   biodiversity-friendly cultural practices in coffee plantations and the
   marketing of certified `biodiversity-friendly' coffee. This paper
   examines the financial feasibility of investing in the certification
   criteria for a `biodiversity-friendly' coffee in farms with different
   production systems in western El Salvador. Models were developed to
   estimate net present values and risks associated with the investment for
   five hypothetical, but typical, coffee farms: (1) traditional
   polyculture; (2) commercial polyculture; (3) technified shade less than
   1200 m elevation; (4) technified shade greater than 1200 m elevation;
   and (5) unshaded monoculture. To invest in the `biodiversity-friendly'
   certification criteria was financially viable in all farms. The unshaded
   monoculture farm type was the most profitable case, and the farm under
   traditional polyculture was the only risk-free. Capital requirements for
   the investment are low, though they increase as shade cover in the farm
   becomes reduced. Small, cash-poor farmers will need assistance to make
   the up-front expenditures required to have the farm certified.
   Incentives for certified biodiversity-friendly coffee plantations such
   as tax relief, payment for environmental services, and soft credits
   could help make the investment more attractive. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {This special issue of the Eurasian Economic Review delves into the
   critical relationships between macro-financial policy frameworks and
   environmental sustainability, emphasizing the urgent challenges posed by
   climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation. These
   environmental crises pose significant threats to global economic and
   financial stability, underscoring the necessity of integrating
   environmental considerations into macro-financial policies to foster
   sustainability and resilience in economic policymaking. Through a
   collection of research papers, this issue explores innovative strategies
   for developing comprehensive policy frameworks that harmonize monetary,
   financial, and fiscal policies with environmental objectives. It
   emphasizes the need for advanced methods to assess and manage the
   financial risks of climate change and environmental degradation.
   Underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach, the research
   advocates for the collaboration of economists, environmental scientists,
   policymakers, and stakeholders to develop effective macro-financial
   policies. These policies aim to mitigate environmental risks, enhance
   environmental sustainability, and preserve biodiversity. The issue calls
   for further research to refine models that accurately predict the
   macro-financial impacts of environmental risks and assess the
   effectiveness of policy measures, paving the way for a sustainable
   future in the face of escalating environmental challenges.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {187},

Abstract = {In New Zealand, 25\% of the remaining indigenous vegetation cover is
   found on mixed livestock farms located predominantly in hill country.
   Despite evidence that adding natural capital stocks in the form of
   biodiversity enhancement is likely to increase the provision of
   ecosystem services on and off farmland, quantitative data are largely

   evaluation of the implications of advancing a biodiversity enhancement
   programme on the financial and environmental performance of three mixed
   livestock farms across New Zealand.
   The research used a farm system optimisation model to quantify the
   effects of biodiversity enhancement on different aspects of the farm
   business. The three farms studied varied in size, geo-climatic zones,
   amount of indigenous vegetation and the size of the proposed
   biodiversity enhancement programme. Shifting even a small part of
   farmland from grazing to biodiversity enhancement affects farm system
   design, resulting in changes to the livestock policy, sale and purchase
   dates of livestock and the grazing management plan. These changes also
   affect farm revenue, Net Present Value and annuity, all of which
   declined by 3-9\% across the three farms over the 10 years modelled.
   However, after implementation of the biodiversity enhancement programme,
   there was a small increase in the annuity per hectare grazed compared
   with the Base farm scenario for two of the three farms studied. The
   provision of other ecosystem services was quantified on one farm, and in
   sharp contrast, these increased, which included greenhouse gas
   regulation with additional C storage and decreased GHG emissions, and
   increased filtering and nutrient retention resulting in a reduction in N
   and P losses to water. Biodiversity enhancement on farm has the
   potential to improve aesthetics, increase sense of place, recreational
   and spiritual values and provision of other food products. The current
   study highlighted the fact that our current farm system models lack the
   capability to provide quantitative information on the provision of
   ecosystem services at the farm scale, and do not include all the natural
   resources across different areas of the farm. This should be a priority
   in the future.},

Abstract = {Our research is directed at revealing the way CBD is approached in terms
   of the decision to finance the actions it entails, with specific
   reference to the case of Romania, in the context of the

   synthetic approach of the objectives related to CBD and the sustainable
   use of its components in Romania, with specific focus on the aspects
   related to solving the critical issues encountered in the field. An
   important part of the present research is dedicated to the problems
   related to the financing of CBD in Romania, both for the period between
   2007 and 2013, as well as for the foreseeable future, up to 2020. We
   will also try to identify the difficulties that may arise and, to a
   certain extent, provide solutions to these issues.},

Abstract = {Pressures are mounting for the adoption of a Global Biodiversity
   Framework that transforms conservation and sustainable use efforts
   worldwide. Underlying this challenge is the biodiversity paradox:
   biological diversity predominantly concentrates in the tropics, while
   human, institutional, and financial resources are primarily located at
   higher latitudes both north and south. Addressing the biodiversity
   paradox requires the expansion and mobilization of human, institutional
   and financial resources around the world. We outline a model championed
   by the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) that builds on the Species
   Conservation Cycle (Assess-Plan-Act-Network-Communicate) and recognizes
   that most conservation action occurs at the national or local level.
   Various strategies are applied to this end by the partners of Reverse
   the Red, a global movement that ignites strategic cooperation and
   science-based action to ensure the survival of wild species and
   ecosystems. The SSC contributes to Reverse the Red through two primary
   strategies: National Species Specialist Groups and Centers for Species
   Survival. By building on existing expert networks and catalyzing efforts
   with established local institutions, we aim to significantly expand
   capacity to implement conservation action at the national level and
   reverse the negative trends indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened
   Species and the Red List of Ecosystems.},
